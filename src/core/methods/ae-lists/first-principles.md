## #39 First Principles Analysis

Strip away assumptions to rebuild from fundamental truths - breakthrough technique for innovation and solving impossible problems

**Pattern:** assumptions → truths → new approach

---

## #40 5 Whys Deep Dive

Repeatedly ask why to drill down to root causes - simple but powerful for understanding failures

**Pattern:** why chain → root cause → solution

---

## #105 Epoché Pure Seeing

**Pattern:** assumptions list → source per assumption → verified only → minimal certainty

## #106 Plato's Cave Inversion

Describe your solution. Now: this is a SHADOW. What is it a shadow of? What TRUE problem are you trying to solve? Does your solution address the shadow or the source?

**Pattern:** solution description → shadow identification → true problem → alignment check
