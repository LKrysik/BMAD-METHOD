# Planning & Risk

**Type:** Domain list (verify + discover)
**Description:** Risk assessment, alignment, trade-offs

Use `aeList: 'planning'` in step frontmatter.

## Verify Methods (5)

### #33 Comparative Analysis Matrix

Multiple analysts evaluate options against weighted criteria - structured decision-making with explicit scoring

**Pattern:** options → criteria → scores → recommendation

### #34 Pre-mortem Analysis

Imagine future failure then work backwards to prevent it - powerful technique for risk mitigation before major launches

**Pattern:** failure scenario → causes → prevention

### #37 Identify Potential Risks

Brainstorm what could go wrong across all categories - fundamental for project planning and deployment preparation

**Pattern:** categories → risks → mitigations

### #71 Alignment Check

Verify artifact realizes its STATED goal. Quote the stated goal. List how artifact addresses EACH part of the goal. List parts of goal NOT addressed. Provide specific evidence with quotes and line numbers.

**Pattern:** goal quote → coverage per part → gaps with evidence

### #73 Coherence Check

Check: Are definitions stable throughout? Does section A contradict section B? Search for contradictory statements and redefinitions. Document contradictions with quotes from BOTH locations.

**Pattern:** definitions stability → contradiction search → dual-location quotes

## Discover Methods (3)

### #39 First Principles Analysis

Strip away assumptions to rebuild from fundamental truths - breakthrough technique for innovation and solving impossible problems

**Pattern:** assumptions → truths → new approach

### #40 5 Whys Deep Dive

Repeatedly ask why to drill down to root causes - simple but powerful for understanding failures

**Pattern:** why chain → root cause → solution

### #27 What If Scenarios

Explore alternative realities to understand possibilities and implications - valuable for contingency planning and exploration

**Pattern:** scenarios → implications → insights
