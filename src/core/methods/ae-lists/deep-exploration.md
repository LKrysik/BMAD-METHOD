# Deep Exploration

**Type:** Discover-only list
**Description:** Advanced philosophical methods for breakthrough insights
**Methods:** 5

Use `aeList: 'deep-exploration'` in step frontmatter.

## #101 Quantum Superposition Hold

FORBID collapsing to one solution too early. Maintain minimum 3 solutions in parallel throughout the process. For each: develop independently. Collapse only at the end with justification why NOW

**Pattern:** 3+ parallel solutions → independent development → delayed collapse with justification

---

## #104 Heisenberg Trade-off Forcing

Identify 2 goals you're optimizing. PROVE they can be achieved simultaneously OR accept they're in fundamental conflict and CHOOSE consciously what you sacrifice

**Pattern:** 2 goals → compatibility proof OR incompatibility acceptance → conscious trade-off

---

## #106 Plato's Cave Inversion

Describe your solution. Now: this is a SHADOW. What is it a shadow of? What TRUE problem are you trying to solve? Does your solution address the shadow or the source?

**Pattern:** solution description → shadow identification → true problem → alignment check

---

## #112 Topological Invariant

STRETCH the problem — what remains when you ignore implementation details? What is the ESSENCE that survives any transformation? This is your true constraint

**Pattern:** problem → stretch/deform → identify invariant core → true constraints

---

## #118 Tunnel Through Impossible

Identify constraint that seems ABSOLUTE. Ask: what if it DIDN'T exist?. Describe solution without that constraint. Now: is it really absolute? Maybe there's a workaround (tunnel)?

**Pattern:** absolute constraints → imagine without → tunnel possibilities
