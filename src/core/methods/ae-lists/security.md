**Description:** Methods for security review and vulnerability assessment
**Methods:** 5

Use `aeList: 'security'` in step frontmatter.

---

## #17 Red Team vs Blue Team

Adversarial attack-defend analysis to find vulnerabilities - critical for security testing and building robust solutions

**Pattern:** defense → attack → hardening

---

## #23 Security Audit Personas

Hacker + defender + auditor examine system from different threat models - comprehensive security review from multiple angles

**Pattern:** vulnerabilities → defenses → compliance

---

## #34 Pre-mortem Analysis

Imagine future failure then work backwards to prevent it - powerful technique for risk mitigation before major launches

**Pattern:** failure scenario → causes → prevention

---

## #35 Failure Mode Analysis

Systematically explore how each component could fail - critical for reliability engineering and safety-critical systems

**Pattern:** components → failures → prevention

---

## #37 Identify Potential Risks

Brainstorm what could go wrong across all categories - fundamental for project planning and deployment preparation

**Pattern:** categories → risks → mitigations
