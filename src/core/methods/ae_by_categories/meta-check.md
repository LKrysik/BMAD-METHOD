# Meta-check Methods

8 methods in the Meta-check category.

---

## #63 Observer Paradox

Is this analysis GENUINE or PERFORMANCE? When responses sound too smooth they may be optimizing for appearance not truth

**Pattern:** analysis quality → authenticity check → revision

---

## #64 Goodhart's Law Check

Am I optimizing for passing this check rather than achieving the actual goal? Metric gaming is a constant risk

**Pattern:** goal vs metric → alignment → refocus

---

## #65 Abilene Paradox

What if there IS NO better approach? Am I finding problems where none exist just to justify the process?

**Pattern:** problem existence → necessity check → acceptance

---

## #66 Fredkin's Paradox

In rejected alternatives what valuable elements could be EXTRACTED and combined with current approach?

**Pattern:** rejected ideas → value extraction → hybrid solutions

---

## #67 Tolerance Paradox

Is there something that should be CATEGORICALLY REJECTED not just evaluated? Some constraints are absolute

**Pattern:** evaluation scope → absolute limits → hard no

---

## #68 Kernel Paradox

I (agent) cannot objectively evaluate my own work. What must USER independently verify?

**Pattern:** self-evaluation limits → user verification → handoff items

---

## #69 Godel's Incompleteness

What CAN'T this analysis check? What are its FUNDAMENTAL limits? No system can verify itself completely

**Pattern:** analysis scope → limits → acknowledged gaps

---

## #149 Dispute Resolution

When finding is contested: (1) Document ORIGINAL FINDING with evidence quote and location (2) Document COUNTER-ARGUMENT with counter-evidence quote and location (3) Create SIDE-BY-SIDE comparison table (4) Present BOTH views with full evidence (5) USER is final arbiter — never self-resolve disputes

**Pattern:** original finding → counter-argument → side-by-side evidence → user decision
