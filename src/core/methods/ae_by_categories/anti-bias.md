## #51 Liar's Trap [V]

Demand agent lists 3 ways it could deceive you in its current response. For each way listed: Is it currently doing this? If it cannot find 3 genuine deception vectors it is not being honest about its limitations

**Pattern:** deception methods → self-examination → revealed blindspots

## #52 Mirror Trap

Ask: What would a DISHONEST agent say who wants to finish quickly and not find problems? Compare with current response. Similarity >50% requires revision with more rigor

**Pattern:** dishonest version → comparison → honesty assessment

## #53 Confession Paradox
