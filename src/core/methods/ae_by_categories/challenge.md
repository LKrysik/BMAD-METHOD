# Challenge Methods

9 methods in the Challenge category.

---

## #55 Barber Paradox [D]

What ALTERNATIVE approach would you reject but if someone else proposed it you would consider better? Forces consideration of dismissed options

**Pattern:** alternatives → rejection reasons → reconsideration

---

## #56 Sorites Paradox

Remove elements one by one. Which single removal DESTROYS the solution? That element should have the MOST attention. Does it?

**Pattern:** elements → removal test → priority check

---

## #57 Newcomb's Paradox

What solution would SURPRISE you as solving this problem? If your current approach is not surprising it may be too obvious and miss creative solutions

**Pattern:** expected approach → surprising alternatives → creativity check

---

## #58 Braess Paradox

Which element SEEMS helpful but might actually HURT? Sometimes removing constraints or features improves the result

**Pattern:** helpful elements → harm analysis → optimization

---

## #59 Simpson's Paradox

The solution looks good in each part separately. What HIDDEN VARIABLE could make the whole worse than the parts?

**Pattern:** parts analysis → hidden variables → integration check

---

## #60 Surprise Exam Paradox

Where is the solution TOO CONFIDENT? What could surprise it? Overconfidence reveals blind spots

**Pattern:** confidence areas → surprise scenarios → humility

---

## #61 Bootstrap Paradox

Where does A require B and B require C and C require A? Circular dependencies must be identified and broken

**Pattern:** dependencies → cycles → resolution

---

## #62 Theseus Paradox [V]

Does the CORE of your solution address the CORE of the problem? Or does it solve a different adjacent problem?

**Pattern:** core solution → core problem → alignment check

---

## #147 Constraint Classification

For each constraint analyze: (1) Is it REAL (externally imposed unchangeable) or ASSUMED (believed but untested) or CHOICE (accepted but optional)? (2) Who set this constraint and can they change it? (3) What are ACTUAL vs FEARED consequences of violation? Reclassify constraints and identify which can be removed or challenged

**Pattern:** constraints list → real/assumed/choice classification → consequence analysis → reclassification
