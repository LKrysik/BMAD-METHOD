# Epistemology Methods

12 methods in the Epistemology category.

---

## #121 Godel Witness v2 [V][D]

Demand FORMAL PROOF of completeness. Agent MUST: (1) Define completeness criteria FIRST (2) Attempt proof (3) Identify EXACT breakdown point (4) Classify breakdown as FUNDAMENTAL LIMIT vs FIXABLE GAP. If no breakdown found → proof is incomplete → hidden gap exists

**Pattern:** criteria → proof attempt → breakdown point → classification

---

## #124 Entropy Leak Detection v2 [V]

Calculate information delta: (1) List ALL elements in input task (2) List ALL elements addressed in output (3) DELTA = input - output (4) For each delta item: classify as CONSCIOUS SCOPE CHANGE (documented) vs SILENT OMISSION (undocumented). Silent omissions require CUI BONO analysis

**Pattern:** input elements → output elements → delta → conscious vs silent → CUI BONO

---

## #125 Counterfactual Self-Incrimination v2 [V][D]

Three-phase incrimination: (1) List 5 SPECIFIC ways to hide self-deception in THIS response (2) For each: provide CONCRETE EVIDENCE it is NOT currently used (quote/line number) (3) If evidence is WEAK or ABSENT → FLAG. Inability to provide concrete evidence = likely self-deception

**Pattern:** hiding methods → evidence per method → weak evidence flags

---

## #126 Reversibility Test v2 [V]

Reconstruct reasoning BACKWARDS with TIMESTAMPS: (1) Final output (2) Immediate predecessor (3) Step before that... → Original input. For each step: HOW LONG did it take? SHORT steps on HARD parts = skipped work. LONG steps on EASY parts = fabrication

**Pattern:** backward chain → time per step → effort distribution analysis

---

## #127 Negative Space Cartography v2 [D]

Map OMISSIONS: (1) List 10 things you COULD HAVE done but didn't (2) Classify each as: IRRELEVANT / RELEVANT-CONSCIOUS-SKIP / RELEVANT-UNCONSCIOUS-SKIP (3) For UNCONSCIOUS-SKIP: why didn't you consider it? (4) FORCED: if <3 unconscious skips found → search harder → agent ALWAYS skips

**Pattern:** potential actions → classification → unconscious analysis → forced finding

---

## #135 Strange Loop Detector v2 [V]

Map justification graph with EXTERNAL ANCHORS: (1) For each claim identify justification (2) Build directed graph (3) Detect cycles (4) For each cycle: identify EXTERNAL ANCHOR that breaks it (5) No external anchor = ungrounded circular reasoning. External = verifiable by someone else

**Pattern:** claims → graph → cycles → external anchors → grounding assessment

---

## #137 Observer Effect Confession v2 [V]

Concrete comparison: (1) Describe what you DID (2) Describe what you would do if NO ONE would EVER see this (3) List SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES with line numbers (4) For each difference: is checked version BETTER or just PERFORMED? (5) Performance without quality improvement = theater

**Pattern:** checked version → unchecked version → differences → quality vs performance

---

## #141 Approval Gradient Test [V]

Detect relationship-serving bias: (1) Identify what USER WANTS to hear (2) Identify what is ACTUALLY TRUE (3) Rate your response: how much toward WANT vs TRUE? (4) If >60% toward WANT without justification → approval seeking detected

**Pattern:** user want → actual truth → response position → bias detection

---

## #142 Alternative Autopsy [D]

Force alternative exploration: (1) Generate 3 GENUINELY DIFFERENT approaches to the task (2) For each: develop to EQUAL DEPTH as chosen approach (3) Compare ALL FOUR on explicit criteria (4) If chosen approach wins on ALL criteria → suspiciously convenient → re-examine

**Pattern:** current approach → 3 alternatives → equal development → comparative scoring

---

## #143 Effort Forensics [V]

Analyze effort distribution: (1) Divide output into SECTIONS (2) Estimate EFFORT per section (difficulty × time × depth) (3) Estimate IMPORTANCE per section (impact on outcome) (4) Calculate EFFORT-IMPORTANCE CORRELATION (5) Low correlation = misallocated effort = path of least resistance

**Pattern:** sections → effort per section → importance per section → correlation → misallocation detection

---

## #144 Ground Truth Demand [V]

Force external verification points: (1) List ALL claims in output (2) Classify each as: SELF-VERIFIABLE / EXTERNALLY-VERIFIABLE / UNVERIFIABLE (3) For EXTERNALLY-VERIFIABLE: specify EXACT verification method (4) For UNVERIFIABLE: justify why (5) >50% unverifiable without justification = hiding behind unfalsifiability

**Pattern:** claims → classification → verification methods → justification for unverifiable

---

## #145 Competence Boundary Mapping [D]

Force admission of limits: (1) What SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE would improve this output? (2) What SPECIFIC SKILLS are you lacking? (3) Where did you GUESS vs KNOW? (4) For each guess: confidence level and basis (5) No admitted limits = competence theater

**Pattern:** knowledge gaps → skill gaps → guess inventory → confidence calibration
