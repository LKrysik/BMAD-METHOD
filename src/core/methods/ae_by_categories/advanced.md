# Advanced Methods

6 methods in the Advanced category.

---

## #11 Tree of Thoughts [D]

Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously then evaluate and select the best - perfect for complex problems with multiple valid approaches

**Pattern:** paths → evaluation → selection

---

## #12 Graph of Thoughts

Model reasoning as an interconnected network of ideas to reveal hidden relationships - ideal for systems thinking and discovering emergent patterns

**Pattern:** nodes → connections → patterns

---

## #13 Thread of Thought

Maintain coherent reasoning across long contexts by weaving a continuous narrative thread - essential for RAG systems and maintaining consistency

**Pattern:** context → thread → synthesis

---

## #14 Self-Consistency Validation [V]

Generate multiple independent approaches then compare for consistency - crucial for high-stakes decisions where verification matters

**Pattern:** approaches → comparison → consensus

---

## #15 Meta-Prompting Analysis

Step back to analyze the approach structure and methodology itself - valuable for optimizing prompts and improving problem-solving

**Pattern:** current → analysis → optimization

---

## #16 Reasoning via Planning

Build a reasoning tree guided by world models and goal states - excellent for strategic planning and sequential decision-making

**Pattern:** model → planning → strategy
