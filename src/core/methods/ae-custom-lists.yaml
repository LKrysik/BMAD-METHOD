# Advanced Elicitation Method Lists
# =================================
#
# SOURCE OF TRUTH for all method lists used in Deep Verify and Deep Discover.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
# 1. Step files specify `aeList: 'list-name'` in frontmatter
# 2. When user selects [V] or [D] in checkpoint menu:
#    - System loads ae-lists/{list-name}.md
#    - Uses verify or discover methods from that list
# 3. Generator creates ae-lists/*.md files from this YAML
#
# LIST TYPES:
# - verify-lists: Methods for verification only (DEEP_VERIFY)
# - discover-lists: Methods for discovery only (DEEP_DISCOVER)
# - domain-lists: Combined lists with both verify AND discover methods
#
# VALIDATION:
# Run: npm run bmad:generate-ae-methods
# Generator validates all method IDs exist in methods.csv
#

# VERIFY-ONLY LISTS
# Use these for steps that primarily need quality checking
