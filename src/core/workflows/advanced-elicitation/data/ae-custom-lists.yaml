# User-Defined Method Lists
# ===========================
#
# Create your own curated method collections for quick access.
# These lists appear under [U] User Lists in the AE workflow menu.
#
# FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
# - Each list must have: name, description, methods (array of method IDs)
# - Method IDs must exist in methods.csv (validated by generator)
# - List names must be unique and URL-safe (lowercase, hyphens allowed)
# - Recommended: 3-10 methods per list for focused sessions
#
# VALIDATION:
# Run: npm run bmad:generate-ae-methods
# Generator will validate all method references and report errors.
#
