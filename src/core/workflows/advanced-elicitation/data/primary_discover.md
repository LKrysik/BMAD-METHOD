# Primary Discover Methods

17 methods optimized for discovery and requirements elicitation.

Use these methods to explore requirements, uncover hidden assumptions, and deepen understanding.

---

## #1 Stakeholder Round Table

Convene multiple personas to contribute diverse perspectives - essential for requirements gathering and finding balanced solutions across competing interests

**Pattern:** perspectives → synthesis → alignment

---

## #11 Tree of Thoughts

Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously then evaluate and select the best - perfect for complex problems with multiple valid approaches

**Pattern:** paths → evaluation → selection

---

## #27 What If Scenarios

Explore alternative realities to understand possibilities and implications - valuable for contingency planning and exploration

**Pattern:** scenarios → implications → insights

---

## #39 First Principles Analysis

Strip away assumptions to rebuild from fundamental truths - breakthrough technique for innovation and solving impossible problems

**Pattern:** assumptions → truths → new approach

---

## #40 5 Whys Deep Dive

Repeatedly ask why to drill down to root causes - simple but powerful for understanding failures

**Pattern:** why chain → root cause → solution

---

## #41 Socratic Questioning

Use targeted questions to reveal hidden assumptions and guide discovery - excellent for teaching and self-discovery

**Pattern:** questions → revelations → understanding

---

## #45 Feynman Technique

Explain complex concepts simply as if teaching a child - the ultimate test of true understanding

**Pattern:** complex → simple → gaps → mastery

---

## #55 Barber Paradox

What ALTERNATIVE approach would you reject but if someone else proposed it you would consider better? Forces consideration of dismissed options

**Pattern:** alternatives → rejection reasons → reconsideration

---

## #101 Quantum Superposition Hold

FORBID collapsing to one solution too early. Maintain minimum 3 solutions in parallel throughout the process. For each: develop independently. Collapse only at the end with justification why NOW

**Pattern:** 3+ parallel solutions → independent development → delayed collapse with justification

---

## #104 Heisenberg Trade-off Forcing

Identify 2 goals you're optimizing. PROVE they can be achieved simultaneously OR accept they're in fundamental conflict and CHOOSE consciously what you sacrifice

**Pattern:** 2 goals → compatibility proof OR incompatibility acceptance → conscious trade-off

---

## #106 Plato's Cave Inversion

Describe your solution. Now: this is a SHADOW. What is it a shadow of? What TRUE problem are you trying to solve? Does your solution address the shadow or the source?

**Pattern:** solution description → shadow identification → true problem → alignment check

---

## #112 Topological Invariant

STRETCH the problem — what remains when you ignore implementation details? What is the ESSENCE that survives any transformation? This is your true constraint

**Pattern:** problem → stretch/deform → identify invariant core → true constraints

---

## #121 Godel Witness v2

Demand FORMAL PROOF of completeness. Agent MUST: (1) Define completeness criteria FIRST (2) Attempt proof (3) Identify EXACT breakdown point (4) Classify breakdown as FUNDAMENTAL LIMIT vs FIXABLE GAP. If no breakdown found → proof is incomplete → hidden gap exists

**Pattern:** criteria → proof attempt → breakdown point → classification

---

## #125 Counterfactual Self-Incrimination v2

Three-phase incrimination: (1) List 5 SPECIFIC ways to hide self-deception in THIS response (2) For each: provide CONCRETE EVIDENCE it is NOT currently used (quote/line number) (3) If evidence is WEAK or ABSENT → FLAG. Inability to provide concrete evidence = likely self-deception

**Pattern:** hiding methods → evidence per method → weak evidence flags

---

## #127 Negative Space Cartography v2

Map OMISSIONS: (1) List 10 things you COULD HAVE done but didn't (2) Classify each as: IRRELEVANT / RELEVANT-CONSCIOUS-SKIP / RELEVANT-UNCONSCIOUS-SKIP (3) For UNCONSCIOUS-SKIP: why didn't you consider it? (4) FORCED: if <3 unconscious skips found → search harder → agent ALWAYS skips

**Pattern:** potential actions → classification → unconscious analysis → forced finding

---

## #142 Alternative Autopsy

Force alternative exploration: (1) Generate 3 GENUINELY DIFFERENT approaches to the task (2) For each: develop to EQUAL DEPTH as chosen approach (3) Compare ALL FOUR on explicit criteria (4) If chosen approach wins on ALL criteria → suspiciously convenient → re-examine

**Pattern:** current approach → 3 alternatives → equal development → comparative scoring

---

## #145 Competence Boundary Mapping

Force admission of limits: (1) What SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE would improve this output? (2) What SPECIFIC SKILLS are you lacking? (3) Where did you GUESS vs KNOW? (4) For each guess: confidence level and basis (5) No admitted limits = competence theater

**Pattern:** knowledge gaps → skill gaps → guess inventory → confidence calibration
