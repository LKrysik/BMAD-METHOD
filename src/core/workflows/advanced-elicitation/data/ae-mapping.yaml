# Advanced Elicitation Method Mappings
# SOURCE OF TRUTH for which methods belong to which roles and modes
#
# This file is manually maintained. The generator uses this to create:
# - data/ae_by_roles/*.md (role-specific method files)
# - data/primary_verify.md
# - data/primary_discover.md

# Role-based method defaults
# Used when user selects [V] or [D] with [P]redefined option
