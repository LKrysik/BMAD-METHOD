# Deep Verify V7.3 - Cognitive Surrogate System

## Overview
**Deep Verify V7.3** resolves the "Efficiency Paradox" by acting as a dynamic hypervisor. It integrates the **Context-Awareness** of V7.2 (for low cost) with the **Error Theory Rigor** of V7.1 (for high performance), switching between them based on **Vector Stability**.

**Best for:** Production environments requiring both economic viability and safety-critical assurance.

## Phase 0: Ontology & Stability Scan (The Gateway)

**Goal:** Diagnose intent and measure "Vector Stability" to route the artifact.

### Step 0.1: Ontology Scan (from V7.2)
Execute **Method #107 (Aristotle's Four Causes)** to determine the **Final Cause** (Purpose).

*   **Material:** Code, Prose, Logic?
*   **Final:** Security, Entertainment, Speed?

### Step 0.2: Stability Check (The Switch)
Execute **Method #67 (Stability Basin Analysis)** and **Method #112 (Entropy Leak)**.

**Check the following triggers:**
1.  **Domain Risk:** Does Ontology include High-Risk Domains (Crypto, Distributed Systems, Auth)?
2.  **Intent/Content Divergence:** Does a "Creative" artifact contain "Executable" code? (Entropy Leak)
3.  **Complexity Spike:** Is the "Conceptual Density" unusually high for the declared type?
4.  **Ambiguity:** Is the Final Cause vague?

**ROUTING DECISION:**
*   **IF** any trigger is **TRUE** → **ROUTE TO TRACK B (DEEP VERIFY)**
*   **IF** all triggers are **FALSE** → **ROUTE TO TRACK A (EFFICIENCY)**

---

## TRACK A: EFFICIENCY TRACK (V7.2 Mode)
**Cost Profile:** Low (~5-10K tokens)
**Use Case:** Creative writing, routine docs, low-risk content.

### A.1 Strategy Selection
Select one lightweight strategy (The Muse, The Teacher, The Generalist).

### A.2 Hygiene Checks
*   **#84 Coherence:** Basic consistency.
*   **#83 Completeness:** No placeholders.
*   **#81 Scope:** Did we answer the prompt?

### A.3 Fast Finish
*   Generate report.
*   **Safety Catch:** If Hygiene checks fail critically, **ESCALATE to Track B**.

---

## TRACK B: DEEP VERIFY TRACK (V7.1 Mode)
**Cost Profile:** High (~30-60K tokens)
**Use Case:** Code, Security, Logic, Complex Systems, "Unstable" Artifacts.

### B.1 Error Theory Taxonomy Scan
Scan for specific Error Vectors (Logic, Security, Concurrency, etc.).

### B.2 Seeded Method Selection
Select methods based on:
1.  **Error Vectors** found in B.1 (Primary weight).
2.  **Domain** (Secondary weight).
3.  **Complexity**.

### B.3 Deep Adaptive Analysis
Execute selected methods with **Method #109 (Contraposition)** and **Method #62 (Failure Mode Analysis)**.

### B.4 Anomaly Detection
Scan for patterns that don't fit the Error Theory taxonomy.

---

## Phase 3: Recursive Learning (The Memory)

**Goal:** Improve the routing logic.

### 3.1 Routing Review
*   Did Track A miss something that Track B would have caught? (False Negative Routing)
*   Did Track B run on something trivial? (False Positive Routing)

### 3.2 Weight Update
Update the **Stability Triggers** in Phase 0.2 based on this outcome.
