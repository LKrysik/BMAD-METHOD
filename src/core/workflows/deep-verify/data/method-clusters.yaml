# Method Clusters — Correlation Rules for Method Selection
# LOAD: step-02-targeted.md
# PURPOSE: Avoid redundant method execution by grouping correlated methods

---

# LOADING INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Load this file at the START of step-02 (Targeted Analysis)
# 2. Before executing a method, check its cluster
# 3. If another method from same cluster already executed:
#    - If first found nothing → SKIP rest of cluster
#    - If first found something → one more can confirm, then SKIP
# 4. Never execute 3+ methods from same cluster

clusters:

  theory:
    name: "Theoretical Analysis"
    methods: [153, 154, 163, 162]
    method_names:
      153: "Theoretical Impossibility Check"
      154: "Definitional Contradiction Detector"
      163: "Existence Proof Demand"
      162: "Theory-Dependence Verification"
    correlation: HIGH
    rule: |
      If first method finds nothing → skip rest of cluster.
      If first method finds something → one more can confirm.
      Never execute 3+ methods from this cluster.
    rationale: "These methods all probe theoretical soundness from similar angles"

  structure:
    name: "Structural Analysis"
    methods: [116, 86, 159]
    method_names:
      116: "Strange Loop Detection"
      86: "Topological Hole Detection"
      159: "Transitive Dependency Closure"
    correlation: HIGH
    rule: |
      If first method finds nothing → skip rest of cluster.
      If first method finds something → one more can confirm.
      Never execute 3+ methods from this cluster.
    rationale: "All examine structural/graph properties of the artifact"

  grounding:
    name: "Grounding Analysis"
    methods: [85, 78, 130]
    method_names:
      85: "Grounding Check"
      78: "Assumption Excavation"
      130: "Assumption Torture"
    correlation: HIGH
    rule: |
      If first method finds nothing → skip rest of cluster.
      If first method finds something → one more can confirm.
      Never execute 3+ methods from this cluster.
    rationale: "All examine assumptions and evidence grounding"

  challenge:
    name: "Challenge Methods"
    methods: [109, 63, 165]
    method_names:
      109: "Contraposition Inversion"
      63: "Challenge from Critical Perspective"
      165: "Constructive Counterexample"
    correlation: MEDIUM
    rule: |
      Lower correlation — can use multiple.
      These attack from genuinely different angles.
      Still avoid all three unless findings warrant.
    rationale: "Challenge methods use different attack vectors"

  absolute_claims:
    signals:
      - "guarantees"
      - "always"
      - "never"
      - "100%"
      - "perfect"
      - "all"
      - "no exceptions"
    recommended_cluster: theory
    recommended_methods: [153, 154, 163]
    rationale: "Absolute claims often violate known theorems"

  structural_complexity:
    signals:
      - "multiple subsystems"
      - "complex interactions"
      - "dependencies"
      - "layers"
      - "components"
    recommended_cluster: structure
    recommended_methods: [116, 86, 159]
    rationale: "Complex structures hide circular dependencies and gaps"

  ungrounded_claims:
    signals:
      - "assertions without justification"
      - "claims without evidence"
      - "unsupported statements"
      - "no references"
    recommended_cluster: grounding
    recommended_methods: [85, 78, 130]
    rationale: "Ungrounded claims need assumption excavation"

  diffuse_belief:
    signals:
      - "general unease"
      - "can't pinpoint problem"
      - "something feels wrong"
      - "intuition flags"
    recommended_methods: [84, 109, 63]
    note: "Mix of coherence (#84) and challenge cluster"
    rationale: "When belief is diffuse, broad attacks may localize the issue"

  clean_phase1:
    signals:
      - "all Tier 1 methods passed"
      - "no findings yet"
      - "looking for hidden issues"
    recommended_methods: [78, 109, 86]
    note: "Assumption excavation + contraposition + structural holes"
    rationale: "If surface is clean, dig deeper for hidden problems"

  constraints:

    - "If method finds nothing, don't repeat cluster"
    - "Challenge cluster has lower correlation, more flexibility"

# USAGE SUMMARY:
#
# 1. Phase 1: Execute all tier1_methods (mandatory, no cluster rules)
# 2. Phase 2: Check signal_to_cluster_mapping for recommended methods
# 3. Before executing: check if cluster already had method executed
# 4. Apply cluster rules: nothing found → skip cluster, something found → one more OK
# 5. Select 2-4 total methods in Phase 2, respecting cluster constraints
