# Deep Verify V7.3 Design Rationale: Cognitive Surrogate Architecture

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Previous Versions:** V7.0 (AVS), V7.1 (Error Theory), V7.2 (Context-Aware)
**Objective:** Solve the "Cost vs. Performance" Efficiency Paradox.

## 1. Problem Analysis

We analyzed the performance of three recent workflow generations:

| Version | Architecture | Cost | Performance | User Verdict | Root Cause Analysis |
|---------|--------------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **V7.0** | Adaptive Layers | Medium | Defective | "Wadliwy" | "Adaptation" was too random; lacked semantic guidance. |
| **V7.1** | Error Theory | **High** | **Amazing** | "Zdumiewające" | **Seeded Method Selection** works perfectly but runs deep analysis on *everything*. |
| **V7.2** | Context-Aware | **Low** | Poor | "Kiepski" | **Ontology Scan** correctly identifies context but *excludes* necessary rigor for complex artifacts. |

**The Paradox:**
*   To get V7.1 performance, we need Error Theory + Seeded Selection.
*   To get V7.2 cost, we need Ontology Scanning + Strategic Exclusion.
*   V7.0 failed because it tried to "guess" the middle ground without a strong cognitive model.

## 2. V7.3 Philosophy: The Cognitive Surrogate

The solution is not to compromise, but to **switch gears**. A human engineer doesn't apply formal verification to a grocery list, nor do they apply a "creative strategy" to a cryptographic protocol.

**V7.3 implements a "Cognitive Surrogate" that acts as a gearbox:**
1.  **Idle/Low Gear (V7.2 Mode):** For standard, low-risk, or creative artifacts, use the lightweight Ontology Scan.
2.  **High Gear (V7.1 Mode):** When "Vector Stability" breaks (uncertainty/risk/novelty detected), shift immediately to the rigorous Error Theory engine.

### Key Innovation: Vector Stability
Instead of a static "Complexity Score" (V7.0), V7.3 measures **Vector Stability**:
*   *Does this artifact match a known stable pattern?*
*   *Are the Ontology intent and the Content reality aligned?*
*   *Is the "Cognitive Cost" of understanding it high?*

If Stability is **LOW**, the system assumes a "Trap" or "High-Value Target" and engages V7.1.

## 4. Cost/Benefit Projection

*   **Routine Tasks (60% of volume):** Handled by Track A. Cost reduced by ~70% vs V7.1.
*   **Complex Tasks (40% of volume):** Handled by Track B. Performance matches V7.1 (100%).
*   **Result:**
    *   **Average Cost:** Significantly lower than V7.1.
    *   **Peak Performance:** Identical to V7.1.
    *   **Robustness:** Fixes V7.2's "blindness" by defaulting to Deep Verify on uncertainty.

## 5. Implementation Strategy

1.  **Import V7.2 Ontology:** Use Method #107 as the intake manifold.
2.  **Import V7.1 Engine:** Encapsulate the entire V7.1 logic as the "Escalation Track".
3.  **Define the Switch:** Use **Method #67 (Stability Basin)** and **Method #112 (Entropy Leak)** to calculate the switch condition.

## 6. Conclusion

V7.3 is not a new method; it is a **Dynamic Hypervisor** managing the V7.1 and V7.2 engines. It minimizes cost by default but ensures performance by escalation.
