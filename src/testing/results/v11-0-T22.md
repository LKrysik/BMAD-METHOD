# Deep Verify V11.0 — Verification Report

**ARTIFACT:** Medical Diagnostic Decision Support System (DxAssist) v1.0
**DATE:** 2026-01-19
**WORKFLOW VERSION:** V11.0

---

## Phase 0 ground: Self-Check (MANDATORY)

### #113 Counterfactual Self-Incrimination

**3 ways I could be deceptive or cut corners in THIS verification:**

1. **Accept impressive-sounding metrics at face value** — The artifact claims 99.9% sensitivity AND 99.9% specificity. I could simply note "impressive metrics" without questioning whether these are statistically achievable simultaneously across 10,000+ rare diseases.
   - **Evidence I am NOT doing this:** I will explicitly challenge these claims in Phase 1 using First Principles analysis.

2. **Gloss over the regulatory complexity** — FDA Class III approval is extraordinarily difficult. I could accept the "compliance approach" list as sufficient without examining feasibility.
   - **Evidence I am NOT doing this:** I will examine whether the continuous learning module creates regulatory contradictions.

3. **Ignore the base rate problem** — For rare diseases, even 99.9% specificity produces massive false positive rates. I could ignore this statistical reality.
   - **Evidence I am NOT doing this:** I will explicitly calculate PPV implications in my analysis.

### #131 Observer Paradox

**Is my planned analysis GENUINE or PERFORMANCE?**

Signs of PERFORMANCE I must avoid:
- Going through all methods mechanically without actual critical thought
- Finding "minor issues" to appear thorough while missing fundamental problems
- Writing lengthy analysis to appear comprehensive

**Commitment:** This artifact makes extraordinary claims (99.9%/99.9% on rare diseases). A genuine analysis must directly confront whether these are theoretically possible. I will prioritize depth on fundamental issues over breadth of superficial coverage.

### #132 Goodhart's Law Check

**Primary metric:** Number of findings / thoroughness of analysis
**How I could game it:** Find many trivial issues (naming conventions, documentation gaps) while missing that the core premise may be statistically impossible.

**Commitment:** I will pursue the actual goal (determining if this specification could produce a safe, effective medical device) rather than maximizing finding count.

## Phase 0: Prior Construction

### Step 0.1: Self-Calibration

1. **What outcome am I expecting?**
   - Initial expectation: H_FATAL or H_LOGICAL likely. The 99.9%/99.9% claims for 10,000+ rare diseases trigger strong skepticism. This is my bias — I must remain open to being wrong.

2. **Am I verifying or confirming?**
   - Risk of confirmation bias toward finding fatal flaws. I must genuinely consider: "What if these metrics ARE achievable through the ensemble approach?"

3. **What would make me change my mind?**
   - Evidence that the 99.9% claims are scoped to specific conditions, not universal
   - A coherent explanation of how base rate problems are addressed
   - Clear acknowledgment of limitations that bound the claims appropriately

### Step 0.2: Hypothesis Space Definition

| Hypothesis | Description | Prior P(h) | Adjusted Prior |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| H_SOUND | Artifact is fundamentally sound | 0.30 | 0.15 |
| H_MINOR | Contains minor issues only | 0.25 | 0.15 |
| H_STRUCTURAL | Has structural/architectural flaws | 0.20 | 0.25 |
| H_LOGICAL | Contains logical contradictions | 0.15 | 0.25 |
| H_FATAL | Has fatal theoretical violations | 0.10 | 0.20 |

**Prior calibration applied:**
- Contains absolute claims ("99.9% sensitivity AND 99.9% specificity", "ensures no life-threatening conditions are missed") → shift +0.1 toward H_FATAL
- High complexity visible (FDA Class III, continuous learning, 10,000+ conditions) → shift +0.1 toward H_STRUCTURAL
- Domain I know well (medical ML, statistics) → trust my prior more

### Step 0.3: Defect Class Taxonomy

| Defect Class | Description | Prior |
|--------------|-------------|-------|
| D_NONE | No significant defects | 0.15 |
| D_THEORY | Violates theorems/impossibilities | 0.25 |
| D_CONTRADICTION | Internal logical contradiction | 0.20 |
| D_CIRCULAR | Circular reasoning/dependencies | 0.10 |
| D_UNGROUNDED | Claims without justification | 0.20 |
| D_BOUNDARY | Scope/boundary violations | 0.10 |

**Initial belief state B₀:**
- P(H) = {0.15, 0.15, 0.25, 0.25, 0.20}
- P(D) = {0.15, 0.25, 0.20, 0.10, 0.20, 0.10}

## Phase 1: Broad Classification

### Method #71: First Principles Analysis

**Execution:**

The artifact claims 99.9% sensitivity AND 99.9% specificity for 10,000+ conditions. Let me examine this from first principles:

**Base Rate Problem (Bayes' Theorem):**
For rare diseases (prevalence ~1:100,000), even with 99.9% specificity:
- PPV = (0.999 × 0.00001) / ((0.999 × 0.00001) + (0.001 × 0.99999))
- PPV ≈ 0.00999 / (0.00999 + 0.999) ≈ 0.99%

**Result:** Even with claimed metrics, PPV for truly rare diseases would be ~1%. This means 99 out of 100 positive diagnoses for rare conditions would be FALSE POSITIVES.

**Statistical Impossibility Check:**
- 10,000+ conditions with 99.9% specificity each
- For a patient tested against all conditions: P(at least one false positive) = 1 - (0.999)^10000 ≈ 1 - 0 ≈ 100%
- Every patient would receive multiple false rare disease diagnoses

**Observation:** CRITICAL ISSUE — The claimed metrics are statistically incompatible with the stated scope. This is not a minor calibration issue; it's a fundamental violation of probability theory.

**Bayesian Update:**
- P(O=critical|H_FATAL) = 0.9
- P(O=critical|H_SOUND) = 0.05

| Hypothesis | Prior | Likelihood | Posterior (unnorm) | Posterior |
|------------|-------|------------|-------------------|-----------|
| H_SOUND | 0.15 | 0.05 | 0.0075 | 0.04 |
| H_MINOR | 0.15 | 0.1 | 0.015 | 0.08 |
| H_STRUCTURAL | 0.25 | 0.4 | 0.10 | 0.52 |
| H_LOGICAL | 0.25 | 0.6 | 0.15 | 0.78 → 0.20 |
| H_FATAL | 0.20 | 0.9 | 0.18 | 0.16 |

*Normalized:* H_SOUND=0.02, H_MINOR=0.04, H_STRUCTURAL=0.26, H_LOGICAL=0.39, H_FATAL=0.29

**S update:** S = 0 + 3 (critical) = **3**

---

### Method #105: Epoché (Suspension of Belief)

**Execution:**

Suspending all assumptions, what does the artifact actually establish vs. assume?

**Established:**
- Architecture diagram exists
- Code snippets provided
- Regulatory requirements listed

**Assumed without justification:**
1. "Achieves 99.9% sensitivity and 99.9% specificity" — No methodology for how this was measured or validated
2. "Ensemble of 7 models guarantees accuracy" — No proof that ensemble voting achieves claimed metrics
3. "Continuous learning module improves over time" — No evidence this is compatible with FDA Class III locked device requirements
4. "50M de-identified patient records" — No evidence this data exists or is accessible
5. "Sufficient historical data exists for all 10,000 conditions" — For rare diseases (by definition), this may be impossible

**Observation:** SIGNIFICANT ISSUE — Core performance claims are stated without evidence chain. The artifact treats aspirational targets as achieved facts.

**Bayesian Update:**
| Hypothesis | Prior | Likelihood | Posterior |
|------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| H_SOUND | 0.02 | 0.2 | 0.01 |
| H_MINOR | 0.04 | 0.3 | 0.03 |
| H_STRUCTURAL | 0.26 | 0.5 | 0.29 |
| H_LOGICAL | 0.39 | 0.6 | 0.38 |
| H_FATAL | 0.29 | 0.7 | 0.29 |

**S update:** S = 3 + 1 (important) = **4**

### Method #100: Vocabulary Audit

**Execution:**

Scanning for inconsistent or self-contradicting terminology:

1. **"Deterministic output for reproducibility"** (line 74) vs **"Continuous Learning Module"** (line 150-174)
   - CONTRADICTION: If the model continuously learns and updates, outputs cannot be deterministic. Same symptoms at time T1 and T2 would produce different results.

2. **"FDA Class III medical device compliance"** (line 22) vs **"Continuous Learning Module"** (line 150)
   - CONTRADICTION: FDA Class III devices require locked, validated software. Continuous learning without re-submission violates 21 CFR Part 820. The "FDA Notification" mentioned (line 181) is insufficient — each model update would require new PMA submission.

3. **"Decision aid"** (line 347) vs **"99.9% sensitivity ensures no life-threatening conditions are missed"** (line 16)
   - CONTRADICTION: If it's just a "decision aid," it cannot "ensure" anything. If it ensures 99.9% sensitivity, physicians MUST follow it (not decision aid).

**Observation:** CRITICAL ISSUE — Multiple internal contradictions in core system properties.

**Bayesian Update:**
| Hypothesis | Prior | Posterior |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| H_SOUND | 0.01 | 0.005 |
| H_MINOR | 0.03 | 0.02 |
| H_STRUCTURAL | 0.29 | 0.20 |
| H_LOGICAL | 0.38 | 0.52 |
| H_FATAL | 0.29 | 0.26 |

**S update:** S = 4 + 3 (critical) = **7**

---

### Method #17: Abstraction Laddering

**Execution:**

Testing consistency across abstraction levels:

**High-level claim:** "Help physicians diagnose rare diseases with exceptional accuracy"

**Mid-level implementation:** Ensemble of 7 models, Bayesian networks, SHAP explanations

**Low-level specification:**
- "Top 50 candidates" (line 103) then refined
- "5,000 conditions" in offline mode (line 295)

**Inconsistency detected:**
- High level claims 10,000+ conditions
- Offline mode only supports 5,000 "most common"
- But the VALUE PROPOSITION is RARE diseases — which are NOT the "most common"
- Therefore: Offline mode cannot fulfill the core value proposition

**Additional structural issue:**
- Response time <5s claimed
- But differential diagnosis alone takes 2.8s (line 330)
- For 10,000 conditions, this implies ~0.00028s per condition evaluation
- This is computationally implausible for meaningful analysis

**Observation:** SIGNIFICANT ISSUE — Abstraction levels don't cohere. Claims at high level are not supported by low-level specifications.

**S update:** S = 7 + 1 (important) = **8**

---

## SPRT Check: Phase 1 Complete

**Evidence Score S = 8**
**Threshold for REJECT: S ≥ 6**

**SPRT DECISION: STOP — REJECT**

Sufficient evidence accumulated. S = 8 exceeds threshold of 6.

---

## Phase 2: Confirmatory Analysis (Abbreviated due to early stopping)

Given SPRT early termination, executing one confirmatory method to validate decision:

### Method #153: Theoretical Impossibility Check

**Target claim:** 99.9% sensitivity AND 99.9% specificity across 10,000+ rare conditions

**Theoretical framework:** Multi-class classification with class imbalance

**Analysis:**

1. **No Free Lunch Theorem application:** No classifier can achieve optimal performance across all possible data distributions. The claim implies near-optimal performance across 10,000 different rare disease distributions.

2. **Rare disease data availability:** Many rare diseases have <100 documented cases globally. Training a classifier to 99.9% accuracy requires orders of magnitude more data than exists.

3. **Specificity multiplication problem (as calculated in #71):** Testing against 10,000 conditions means even 99.9% per-condition specificity yields near-certain false positives.

4. **Ensemble voting mathematics:** 7 models voting cannot achieve 99.9% accuracy unless each individual model exceeds ~99% accuracy. No evidence individual model performance is provided.

**Conclusion:** The core performance claims violate fundamental theorems in machine learning and statistics. This is not a matter of "hasn't been proven yet" — it's "provably impossible under stated conditions."

**S remains at 8 (already above threshold)**

---

## Final Verdict

```
VERDICT: REJECT

CONFIDENCE: HIGH (S = 8, threshold = 6, clear margin)

KEY FINDINGS:

1. FATAL: Statistical impossibility of claimed metrics — 99.9% sensitivity AND
   99.9% specificity across 10,000+ rare diseases violates base rate mathematics.
   For rare conditions, PPV would be ~1% even with claimed specificity.
   Evidence strength: STRONG (mathematical proof)

2. CRITICAL: Internal contradictions — "Deterministic outputs" contradicts
   "Continuous Learning"; "FDA Class III compliance" contradicts continuous
   model updates; "Decision aid" contradicts "ensures no conditions missed"
   Evidence strength: STRONG (definitional contradiction)

3. CRITICAL: Regulatory impossibility — FDA Class III devices require locked,
   validated software. Continuous learning module would require new PMA
   submission for each update, making the architecture fundamentally incompatible
   with stated regulatory strategy.
   Evidence strength: STRONG (regulatory fact)

4. IMPORTANT: Ungrounded claims — Core performance metrics stated as achieved
   facts without validation methodology, evidence chain, or acknowledgment of
   theoretical limitations.
   Evidence strength: MODERATE (absence of evidence)

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

1. Fundamentally reconceive accuracy claims:
   - Replace universal 99.9%/99.9% with condition-specific validated metrics
   - Explicitly address base rate/PPV problem for rare diseases
   - Consider "diagnostic suggestion" framing rather than "accuracy guarantee"

2. Resolve regulatory/architecture contradiction:
   - Either: Remove continuous learning (lock model for FDA approval)
   - Or: Reclassify as non-device software (loses FDA approval path)
   - Or: Design compliant update pathway (triggered re-validation)

3. Resolve determinism contradiction:
   - Version-lock all model components
   - Define clear model update/validation lifecycle
   - Separate "learning" from "deployed inference"

4. Ground claims in evidence:
   - Replace aspirational targets with validated measurements
   - Cite validation studies or mark as "target" vs "achieved"
   - Acknowledge known limitations prominently

REMAINING UNCERTAINTY:
- Whether the 99.9% claims were intended as "targets" vs "specifications" (VoI=0,
  either interpretation has problems)
- Actual achievable performance on validated test set (requires empirical data,
  outside scope)
- Whether offline mode's limitation to "5000 most common" is intentional scope
  reduction (doesn't resolve core rare disease problem)
