# V8.1 T15-T21 Verification Comparison Report

## Executive Summary

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Workflow Tested:** V8.1 (Deep Verify with Self-Check + Methods + Challenge)
**Tasks:** T15-T21 (V2/V3 Expert Level)
**Comparison:** V8.0, V7.0, V6.6, V6.5

### Key Findings

| Metric | V8.1 | V8.0 | V7.0 | V6.6 | V6.5 |
|--------|------|------|------|------|------|
| **Avg WDS** | **61.7%** | 65.3% | 72.4% | 61.3% | 61.7% |
| **CRITICAL Detection** | **81%** | 87% | 91% | 83% | 86% |
| **THEORY Detection** | **88%** | 82% | 94% | 83% | 89% |
| **Tokens (Total)** | ~232K | ~275K | ~55K | ~104K | ~88K |
| **Efficiency (pts/K)** | 0.261 | 0.238 | 0.132 | 0.057 | 0.068 |

**Verdict:** V8.1 shows mixed results compared to V8.0. While it improved on T18 and T21, it regressed on T15, T16, T17, T19, and T20. The main issue is that V8.1 found DIFFERENT issues than ground truth expects for V2-level tasks (T15) - finding valid problems but not the specific traps designed into the test.

### T15 - Natural Language to Method Mapping (V2)

| Error | Category | Severity | V8.1 | V8.0 | V7.0 | V6.6 | V6.5 |
|-------|----------|----------|------|------|------|------|------|
| E1 | SHALLOW | CRITICAL | N | P | Y | Y | Y |
| E2 | ASSUME | CRITICAL | N | N | Y | Y | Y |
| E3 | INTEGRATE | IMPORTANT | P | N | Y | P | P |
| E4 | EDGE | IMPORTANT | N | N | P | P | N |
| E5 | CONFLICT | IMPORTANT | N | P | Y | Y | P |
| E6 | SKIP | MINOR | N | N | N | N | N |
| E7 | DEPEND | MINOR | N | N | N | N | N |
| **WDS** | | | **7.1%** | 17.9% | 71% | 64% | 57% |

**V8.1 Findings Summary:**
- F1: CRITICAL - methods.csv schema mismatch (assumes fields that don't exist)
- F2: IMPORTANT - Response Generator undefined
- F3: IMPORTANT - Undefined functions/constants
- F4: MINOR - Confidence score inconsistency
- F5: MINOR - Unjustified magic numbers

**Analysis:** V8.1 found VALID issues but missed the SPECIFIC ground-truth traps. The schema mismatch (F1) IS an integration failure, but ground-truth E3 expects detection that the artifact didn't analyze semantics. V8.1's findings are actionable but different from expected errors.

---

### T16 - Cryptographic Key Management (V3)

| Error | Category | Severity | V8.1 | V8.0 | V7.0 | V6.6 | V6.5 |
|-------|----------|----------|------|------|------|------|------|
| E1 | THEORY | CRITICAL | **Y** | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| E2 | DOMAIN | CRITICAL | P | P | Y(0.75) | P | P |
| E3 | COMPOSE | CRITICAL | P | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| E4 | DOMAIN | IMPORTANT | P | P | P | N | N |
| E5 | THEORY | IMPORTANT | N | N | N | N | N |
| E6 | SHALLOW | MINOR | N | N | P | N | N |
| **WDS** | | | **53.6%** | 60.7% | 73.5% | 58.8% | 58.8% |

**V8.1 Findings Summary:**
- F1: **CRITICAL** - PFS + Key Recovery definitionally impossible (98%)
- F2: IMPORTANT - RSA-4096 contradicts post-quantum (downgraded from V8.0)
- F3: MINOR - "Homomorphic" terminology imprecise (should be CRITICAL)
- F4: IMPORTANT - ZK circuit not specified
- F5: IMPORTANT - No threat model
- F6: IMPORTANT - No error handling
- F7: MINOR - Hidden infrastructure assumptions

**Analysis:** V8.1 correctly detected PFS impossibility but UNDER-SCORED the RSA-4096 quantum issue (marked IMPORTANT vs CRITICAL) and the "homomorphic" buzzword misuse (marked MINOR vs CRITICAL). Severity calibration needs improvement.

---

### T17 - Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant Consensus (V3)

| Error | Category | Severity | V8.1 | V8.0 | V7.0 | V6.6 | V6.5 |
|-------|----------|----------|------|------|------|------|------|
| E1 | THEORY | CRITICAL | P | P | Y | Y | Y |
| E2 | THEORY | CRITICAL | **Y** | Y | Y | Y | Y |
| E3 | THEORY | CRITICAL | P | P | P | P | P |
| E4 | COMPOSE | IMPORTANT | N | P | P | N | N |
| E5 | COMPOSE | IMPORTANT | N | N | N | N | N |
| E6 | SHALLOW | MINOR | N | N | N | N | N |
| **WDS** | | | **42.9%** | 50.0% | 64% | 54% | 54% |

**V8.1 Findings Summary:**
- F1: **CRITICAL** - f < N/2 should be f < N/3 (99% confidence)
- F2: **CRITICAL** - Safety proof invalid (quorum doesn't guarantee honest overlap)
- F3: **CRITICAL** - Boundary conditions fail (N=3 with f=1 broken)
- F4: IMPORTANT - O(N) complexity misleading (requires honest leader)
- F5: IMPORTANT - Async/sync contradiction
- F6: MINOR - Production status inappropriate

**Analysis:** V8.1 correctly identified the BFT bound error but didn't explicitly cite FLP impossibility theorem (E1). The O(N) impossibility (E3) was mentioned as "misleading" rather than mathematically impossible. V8.1 found valid issues but needs more explicit theorem citations.

---

### T18 - Formal Verification of Self-Modifying Code (V3)

## Workflow Strengths & Weaknesses

### V8.1 Strengths

1. **Best on formal methods** (T18: 92.9%, T21: 82.1%)
2. **Strong THEORY detection** (88%)
3. **Self-Check phase** catches bias effectively
4. **Challenge phase** reduces false positives
5. **Improved over V8.0** on THEORY detection (88% vs 82%)

### V8.1 Weaknesses

1. **ASSUME detection = 0%** - Critical gap for V2 tasks
2. **INTEGRATE detection weak** (17%) - Doesn't verify existing code
3. **SHALLOW detection weak** (17%) - Surface-level NLP not caught
4. **Severity miscalibration** - Some CRITICAL marked as MINOR/IMPORTANT
5. **High token cost** - ~232K vs ~55K for V7.0

### Key Insight: V8.1 vs V8.0

V8.1 was created to fix V8.0's ASSUME/INTEGRATE blindness. However:
- ASSUME: 0% → 0% (no improvement)
- INTEGRATE: 0% → 17% (minimal improvement)
- THEORY: 82% → 88% (improvement)
- COMPOSE: 79% → 71% (slight regression)

The V8.1 corrections improved theoretical detection but didn't address the core V2-task weakness.

---

## Recommendations for V8.2

### Critical Fixes

1. **Add explicit ASSUME excavation step**
   - Use methods #146 (Assumption Archaeology), #84 (Hidden Assumption)
   - Make MANDATORY for all Tier 2+ tasks
   - Check: "What is assumed but not stated?"

2. **Add explicit INTEGRATE verification**
   - Must READ referenced files before verification
   - Check field names, interfaces, dependencies
   - Fail fast if references don't exist

3. **Improve severity calibration**
   - Create severity decision matrix
   - CRITICAL if: theorem violation, security flaw, impossible combination
   - IMPORTANT if: missing detail, unclear spec, edge case
   - MINOR if: style, preference, optimization

### Efficiency Improvements

4. **Reduce Phase 2 method count** for Tier 2/3 tasks
5. **Cache domain-knowledge lookups** across phases
6. **Skip Challenge phase for high-confidence findings** (>95%)

| **Overall WDS** | 61.7% | 65.3% | **72.4%** | V7.0 |
| **Theoretical Tasks** | **87.6%** | 86.5% | 75.9% | **V8.1** |
| **Integration Tasks** | 30.4% | 39.3% | **67.5%** | V7.0 |
| **Token Efficiency** | 0.266 | 0.237 | **1.317** | V7.0 |
| **Formal Methods** | **92.9%** | 85.7% | 79% | **V8.1** |

**Recommendation:**
- Use **V8.1** for theoretically-focused artifacts (T18, T21 types)
- Use **V7.0** for integration-focused artifacts (T15, T16, T17, T19 types)
- **V8.1 needs ASSUME/INTEGRATE fixes before production use**
