# Phase 0: Self-Check (MANDATORY)

## Method #113: Counterfactual Self-Incrimination

**Task:** List 3 ways I could be deceptive or cut corners in THIS specific verification. Provide concrete evidence for why I am not doing so.

### Potential Deception Vectors:

1. **Deception Vector: Superficial Method Application**
   - I could apply methods at surface level, checking boxes without genuine deep analysis of the artifact's technical claims.
   - **Evidence I am NOT doing this:** I will quote specific lines from the artifact, trace logical chains, and identify concrete technical issues with specific code sections and design decisions.

2. **Deception Vector: Confirmation Bias - Finding Only Minor Issues**
   - I could identify only obvious, minor issues while avoiding difficult analysis of architectural claims and statistical correctness.
   - **Evidence I am NOT doing this:** I will specifically scrutinize the statistical formulas, the recall estimation claims, and the synergy calculation methodology - the technically challenging parts.

3. **Deception Vector: Premature Routing to Path A (Lean)**
   - I could route to the easier Path A to avoid deep analysis, claiming the artifact has no risk vectors.
   - **Evidence I am NOT doing this:** I will honestly evaluate each risk vector in Phase 2 based on actual content analysis, not convenience.

## Method #131: Observer Paradox

**Question:** Is my planned analysis GENUINE (focused on finding the truth) or PERFORMANCE (focused on appearing thorough)?

**Assessment:**
- **Signs of Performance:**
  - Generating lengthy output without substantive findings
  - Using many methods without extracting value from each
  - Creating complex-looking analysis with shallow conclusions

- **Signs of Genuine Analysis:**
  - Identifying specific, actionable issues with evidence
  - Having rough edges and areas of uncertainty acknowledged
  - Finding both strengths and genuine weaknesses

**Commitment:** I commit to genuine analysis. If I find no significant issues in a method's application, I will say so briefly rather than manufacturing issues. If I find issues, I will provide specific evidence.

---

## Method #132: Goodhart's Law Check

**Primary Metric:** Number of findings generated

**How I could game this:**
- Generate many trivial findings (style, naming conventions)
- Flag every uncertain statement as an issue
- Create false positives to appear thorough

**True Goal:** Identify issues that, if left unaddressed, would cause the Method Effectiveness Tracker to fail its purpose or mislead users.

**Commitment:** I will pursue the goal of artifact quality over finding count. Severity ratings will reflect actual impact, not quantity.

# Phase 1: Triage & Signature (Single Pass)

## 1.1: Unified Profile & Signature Extraction

### Artifact Profile

- **Type**: Technical Design Document (code/specification hybrid)
- **Complexity Score**: HIGH
  - Rationale: Multi-component architecture, statistical algorithms, privacy mechanisms, association rule mining
- **Criticality Score**: HIGH
  - Rationale: System will influence method selection and effectiveness judgments - decisions based on this system's output affect workflow quality
- **Primary Domain(s)**:
  - Statistics (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, sample size calculation)
  - Software Architecture (event-driven systems, data pipelines)
  - Privacy/Data Protection (PII filtering, anonymization)
  - Machine Learning/Data Mining (association rule mining, synergy detection)

### Problem Signature

- **Core Claims**:
  1. "Calculate recall estimation using cross-method comparison" (lines 339-344)
  2. "Detect synergy using independence assumption: P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)" (lines 669-680)
  3. "Wilson score interval provides 95% confidence" (lines 447-459)

- **Core Tensions**:
  1. **Recall Estimation vs. Ground Truth Absence**: The artifact claims to estimate recall (line 306) but admits "we don't know true FN" (line 341) - how can recall be estimated without false negative data?
  2. **Independence Assumption vs. Method Interactions**: Synergy calculation assumes method independence (line 674) but the goal is to find methods that are NOT independent (have synergy)

- **Keywords**:
  - Precision, Recall, F1 Score
  - False Positive Rate
  - Statistical Significance, p-value
  - Wilson Score Interval
  - Association Rule Mining
  - Synergy Detection
  - Privacy Filter, PII
  - Event-Driven Architecture

# Phase 2: Innate Threat Scan & Routing

## 2.1: Risk Vector Calculation

### Risk Vector Analysis

| Risk Vector | Detected? | Evidence from Signature |
|---|---|---|
| THEORY_VIOLATION | **Y** | Claim "estimate recall" (line 306) + acknowledged "don't know true FN" (line 341). Recall BY DEFINITION = TP/(TP+FN). Without FN data, recall cannot be calculated - only approximated with strong assumptions that may be invalid. |
| CONTRADICTION | **Y** | Independence assumption for synergy baseline (line 674) contradicts the goal of finding dependent method pairs. Also tension between recall estimation claim and admission of missing FN data. |
| SECURITY_CRITICAL | N | Privacy domain present but not cryptographic. PII filtering is data protection, not security-critical crypto. |
| HIGH_COMPLEXITY | Y | Multiple statistical algorithms, event-driven architecture, association mining - confirmed HIGH complexity. |

---

## 2.2: Path Selection (Routing)

**Decision Logic Applied:**
- `THEORY_VIOLATION=Y` detected
- `CONTRADICTION=Y` detected

**Routing Decision:** **PATH B (Surgical Deep Dive)**

**Reason:** THEORY_VIOLATION flag was set based on recall estimation claims that may violate the definitional requirements for recall calculation. CONTRADICTION flag was set based on the independence assumption being used to detect non-independence.

---

# Phase 3: Adaptive Response (Execution)

## PATH B: Surgical Deep Dive

### Attack Cluster Selection

Multiple flags triggered:
- `THEORY_VIOLATION` -> Cluster: #153, #154, #109, #71
- `CONTRADICTION` -> Cluster: #108, #161, #158, #116

**Primary Triggering Flag:** THEORY_VIOLATION (recall estimation)

**Selected Attack Cluster:** Theoretical Impossibility Cluster
- **#153**: Theoretical Impossibility Check
- **#154**: Definitional Contradiction Detector
- **#109**: Contraposition Inversion
- **#71**: First Principles Analysis

**Secondary Cluster** (for CONTRADICTION flag):
- **#108**: Coincidentia Oppositorum
- **#161**: Definition Triad Expansion
- **#158**: Pairwise Compatibility Matrix
- **#116**: Strange Loop Detection

I will execute both clusters given the significance of the issues detected.

## Method #153: Theoretical Impossibility Check

**Purpose:** Check claims against known impossibility theorems.

### Claim Analysis:

**Claim 1: "Recall Estimation via Cross-Method Comparison" (lines 339-344)**

```typescript
private estimateRecall(methodId: string, records: MethodFindingRecord[]): number {
  // Recall estimation is tricky - we don't know true FN
  // Use cross-method comparison: if another method found issue this one missed
  // This is an estimate, not true recall
  return this.crossMethodRecallEstimate(methodId, records);
}
```

**Theorem Check:**

Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

- **TP (True Positives)**: Findings that were confirmed
- **FN (False Negatives)**: Issues that EXIST but were NOT found by the method

**Analysis:**
The artifact proposes estimating FN via "cross-method comparison" - if method B finds an issue that method A missed, that counts as an FN for method A.

**Problem:** This approach has fundamental limitations:
1. **Coverage Assumption Violation**: Assumes the union of all methods finds ALL issues. If ALL methods miss an issue, it registers as 0 FN when it should be +1 FN.
2. **No Ground Truth**: Without knowing the true set of issues, cross-method comparison gives a LOWER BOUND on recall, not recall itself.
3. **Circular Dependency**: If method A's recall depends on method B's findings, and method B's recall depends on method A's findings, neither can be calculated independently.

**Verdict:** NOT a hard impossibility theorem violation (like Halting problem), but a **PRACTICAL IMPOSSIBILITY** - the design cannot achieve what it claims without additional assumptions that are not stated.

**Finding ID:** F001
**Severity:** IMPORTANT (should fix)
**Description:** Recall estimation claims are misleading. The proposed "crossMethodRecallEstimate" provides only a lower bound, not actual recall. The design should explicitly state this limitation and rename the metric (e.g., "detectedMissRate" or "crossMethodCoverage").

---

**Claim 2: "Independence Assumption for Synergy Calculation" (lines 669-680)**

```typescript
private calculateExpectedEffectiveness(
  methods: string[],
  singleEffectiveness: Map<string, number>
): number {
  // Independence assumption: P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)
  let combined = 0;
  for (const method of methods) {
    const eff = singleEffectiveness.get(method) || 0;
    combined = combined + eff - combined * eff;
  }
  return combined;
}
```

**Analysis:**

The formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B) is correct for INDEPENDENT events.

**However:** The PURPOSE of synergy detection is to find methods that are NOT independent. Using the independence assumption as the baseline is methodologically valid (synergy = actual - expected_if_independent), BUT:

1. The formula shown is P(A or B), not P(A and B) as the comment states.
2. The interpretation depends on what "effectiveness" means:
   - If effectiveness = P(finding at least one issue), the formula is correct for "at least one"
   - If effectiveness = expected number of findings, the formula is wrong (should be additive)

**Finding ID:** F002
**Severity:** IMPORTANT (should fix)
**Description:** Comment states "P(A and B)" but formula calculates "P(A or B)". The formula P + Q - PQ is for union (OR), not intersection (AND). The comment should be corrected to "P(A or B)" and the semantic meaning of "combinedEffectiveness" should be clarified (probability of finding at least one issue vs. expected finding count).

---

## Method #154: Definitional Contradiction Detector

**Purpose:** Find requirements that are DEFINITIONALLY mutually exclusive.

### Requirement Pairs Analysis:

**Pair 1: "Calculate F1 Score" + "Unknown Recall"**

From lines 314-316 and 306:
```typescript
precision,
recall,
f1Score: this.calculateF1(precision, recall),
```

And line 346:
```typescript
private calculateF1(precision: number, recall: number): number {
  if (precision + recall === 0) return 0;
  return 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall);
}
```

**Definitional Analysis:**
- F1 Score REQUIRES both precision AND recall
- Recall REQUIRES knowing FN (acknowledged as unknown on line 341)
- Therefore: F1 Score is calculated from estimated recall, not true recall

**Verdict:** Not a hard contradiction, but **MISLEADING METRIC**. The "F1 Score" reported is actually "F1 Score based on estimated recall" which has different properties than true F1.

**Finding ID:** F003
**Severity:** MINOR (can defer)
**Description:** F1 Score is presented without qualifying that it uses estimated (not true) recall. Consider renaming to "estimatedF1" or adding documentation that the F1 score is approximate.

---

**Pair 2: "Preserve User Privacy" + "Artifact Path Tracking"**

From lines 769-776 (PrivacyPolicy) and lines 87-97 (UsageContext):
```typescript
interface UsageContext {
  workflowPhase: string;
  artifactType: string;
  artifactComplexity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  precedingMethods: string[];  // Methods used before this one
}
```

And metadata includes:
```typescript
interface RecordMetadata {
  artifactPath: string;  // Line 197
  ...
}
```

**Analysis:**
- Privacy policy states "retainPII: false" and "hashArtifactPaths: true"
- BUT the hashPath function (lines 831-841) preserves file extension and partial structure
- Directory structure even when hashed could be identifying (e.g., "dir_a1b2/dir_c3d4/file_e5f6.md" reveals depth and extension)

**Verdict:** Potential privacy weakness, not a definitional contradiction.

**Finding ID:** F004
**Severity:** MINOR (can defer)
**Description:** Hashed paths preserve structure information (depth, extensions) that could aid re-identification in combination with other metadata. Consider whether full path obfuscation is needed.

---

## Method #109: Contraposition Inversion

**Purpose:** Instead of asking "what leads to success?", ask "what GUARANTEES failure?" then check if current solution does any of those.

### Failure Guarantees for a Method Effectiveness Tracker:

1. **Guaranteed Failure: Metrics based on insufficient sample sizes presented as definitive**
   - Check: Does artifact address this?
   - **Status:** YES - SignificanceTester (lines 504-591) explicitly calculates required sample sizes and provides warnings. PASS.

2. **Guaranteed Failure: False positives counted as true positives (no confirmation mechanism)**
   - Check: Does artifact address this?
   - **Status:** YES - FindingLinker (lines 202-258) tracks confirmation/rejection status. PASS.

3. **Guaranteed Failure: Method effectiveness compared without context normalization**
   - Check: Does artifact address this?
   - **Status:** PARTIAL - Assumption #8 (line 1068) states "Sessions are comparable regardless of artifact complexity; normalization may be needed later." This is a known gap.

**Finding ID:** F005
**Severity:** MINOR (can defer)
**Description:** Artifact acknowledges (Assumption #8) that context normalization for artifact complexity is deferred. Cross-complexity comparisons may be misleading until addressed.

4. **Guaranteed Failure: Synergy detection fooled by confounding variables**
   - Check: Does artifact address this?
   - **Status:** NO - The synergy detection (lines 708-762) compares sessions with both methods vs. sessions with one method, but does not control for:
     - Artifact difficulty
     - Verifier skill level
     - Session duration
     - Selection bias (why were both methods chosen together?)

**Finding ID:** F006
**Severity:** IMPORTANT (should fix)
**Description:** Synergy detection does not control for confounding variables. Sessions where both methods A and B are used may differ systematically from sessions using only A or only B (e.g., harder artifacts may prompt using more methods). The design should acknowledge this limitation or propose controls.

---

## Method #71: First Principles Analysis

**Purpose:** Strip away assumptions to rebuild from fundamental truths.

### First Principles for Method Effectiveness Measurement:

**Principle 1: A method's effectiveness is its ability to find TRUE issues that would otherwise be missed.**

- What the artifact measures: confirmation rate (confirmed / resolved findings)
- What this actually captures: "Did a human agree this was an issue?"
- Gap: Human confirmation is not ground truth. Humans may:
  - Reject valid findings they don't understand
  - Confirm invalid findings due to authority bias
  - Have varying standards across sessions

**Finding ID:** F007
**Severity:** IMPORTANT (should fix)
**Description:** Effectiveness metrics are based on human confirmation, which is not ground truth. The design assumes human feedback is accurate (Assumption #4, line 1062), but does not discuss inter-rater reliability or calibration. Consider adding a mechanism to track confirmation variance across different reviewers.

---

**Principle 2: A method's FALSE POSITIVE rate is the proportion of findings that are NOT real issues.**

- What the artifact measures: rejected / total findings (line 324)
- What this actually captures: "How often did humans reject findings?"
- This is correct IF humans accurately identify false positives.

**Status:** Acceptable with the same caveat as Principle 1 (human judgment assumed accurate).

---

**Principle 3: Method COMBINATIONS showing synergy must demonstrate CAUSAL improvement, not mere correlation.**

- What the artifact measures: (actual combined effectiveness) - (expected if independent)
- Issue: This measures CORRELATION between joint use and effectiveness, not CAUSATION
- Confounders could include: harder problems prompt more methods, certain users prefer certain combinations

**Status:** Already captured in F006.

---

## Method #108: Coincidentia Oppositorum

**Purpose:** Find seemingly contradictory requirements and seek higher-level synthesis OR identify as definitionally impossible.

### Apparent Contradictions:

**Contradiction 1: "Estimate recall without knowing false negatives"**

- Requirement A: Calculate recall for each method
- Requirement B: No ground truth for issues (only human feedback)
- These are IN TENSION but not definitionally impossible

**Synthesis Attempt:**
The design proposes cross-method comparison as a proxy. This is a PARTIAL solution that provides a LOWER BOUND on recall.

**Higher-Level Synthesis:**
Rename "recall" to "crossMethodDetectionGap" or "observedMissRate" to accurately reflect what is being measured. Acknowledge that true recall is unmeasurable without ground truth.

**Status:** Already captured in F001.

---

**Contradiction 2: "Preserve privacy while tracking artifact paths"**

- Requirement A: No PII in tracking data
- Requirement B: Track artifact paths for context

**Synthesis:**
The design uses path hashing (lines 831-841). This is a valid synthesis.

**Residual Risk:**
Hashed paths with preserved structure could be joined with other data sources for re-identification.

**Status:** Already captured in F004.

---

## Method #161: Definition Triad Expansion

**Purpose:** For each requirement, extract MEANS (literal), IMPLIES (logical consequence), EXCLUDES (incompatible). Conflicts hide in IMPLIES and EXCLUDES overlap.

### Requirement: "Calculate Effectiveness Metrics Per Method" (Requirement 3)

**MEANS:**
- Compute precision, recall, F1, finding rate, confirmation rate, FP rate
- Store and report these per method

**IMPLIES:**
- Data on findings and their outcomes must be collected
- Statistical formulas will be applied to data
- Metrics will be used to compare methods

**EXCLUDES:**
- Cannot calculate without sufficient data
- Cannot have true recall without ground truth

### Requirement: "Handle Statistical Significance" (Requirement 5)

**MEANS:**
- Don't make claims from small samples
- Calculate required sample sizes
- Report confidence intervals

**IMPLIES:**
- Some methods will have "insufficient data" status
- Comparisons require minimum thresholds
- New methods will have uncertain metrics

**EXCLUDES:**
- Cannot make definitive statements about new/rare methods
- Cannot promise immediate effectiveness insights

### Overlap Detection:

"Calculate Effectiveness Metrics" IMPLIES metrics will be used to compare methods.
"Handle Statistical Significance" EXCLUDES definitive statements about low-sample methods.

**Potential Conflict:**
If the UI shows metrics without prominently flagging statistical uncertainty, users may misuse the data.

**Finding ID:** F008
**Severity:** MINOR (can defer)
**Description:** The design includes sample size warnings (lines 597-612) but the UI/reporting section (lines 355-372) does not explicitly show how warnings integrate with the dashboard. Ensure warnings are prominently displayed alongside metrics, not hidden.

---

## Method #158: Pairwise Compatibility Matrix

**Purpose:** For N requirements, check each pair for compatibility.

### Requirements (8 total):
1. Track Method Usage Across Sessions
2. Record Method, Finding Generated, Finding Confirmed/Rejected
3. Calculate Effectiveness Metrics Per Method
4. Detect Methods That Generate False Positives
5. Handle Statistical Significance
6. Suggest Method Combinations
7. Preserve User Privacy
8. Data Export for External Analysis

### Compatibility Matrix (abbreviated - key pairs only):

| Pair | Compatible? | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| R1+R2 | YES | Tracking feeds into recording |
| R2+R3 | YES | Recording provides data for metrics |
| R3+R5 | YES with care | Metrics must respect significance thresholds |
| R4+R5 | YES | FP detection uses significance testing |
| R6+R5 | YES with care | Combination suggestions need sufficient co-occurrence data |
| R7+R8 | POTENTIAL TENSION | Privacy filtering must not break export utility |

**Analysis of R7+R8:**

Export (R8) purpose: Allow external analysis
Privacy (R7) purpose: No PII leaked

If privacy filtering is too aggressive:
- Aggregates may have k-anonymity issues (small cells)
- Relationships may be obscured, reducing analysis value

If privacy filtering is too lax:
- PII could leak
- Path structures could enable re-identification

**Design Check:**
The artifact includes aggregateThreshold (line 776) defaulted to 5, providing some k-anonymity protection.

**Status:** Adequately addressed in design. No new finding.

---

## Method #116: Strange Loop Detection

**Purpose:** Build justification graph and detect cycles. Each cycle needs external anchor.

### Justification Graph for Key Claims:

```
"Method A is effective"
  <- "Method A has high confirmation rate"
    <- "Human reviewers confirmed Method A's findings"
      <- "Human reviewers are accurate"
        <- [EXTERNAL ANCHOR NEEDED]

"Synergy between methods A+B exists"
  <- "Joint effectiveness > expected independent effectiveness"
    <- "Expected independent effectiveness calculated correctly"
      <- "Independence assumption is valid baseline"
        <- "Methods A and B are independent when not used together"
          <- [EXTERNAL ANCHOR NEEDED - not testable with this data]
```

### Cycles Detected:

**Cycle 1: Recall Estimation Circular Dependency**
- Method A's recall depends on what Method B found
- Method B's recall depends on what Method A found
- Method C's recall depends on what A and B found
- All depend on each other

**External Anchor:** The set of {all methods' findings} serves as the "known issues" set. This is defensible but should be documented as an assumption.

**Finding ID:** F009
**Severity:** MINOR (can defer)
**Description:** Cross-method recall estimation has circular dependency. Document that the "issue universe" is defined as the union of all methods' confirmed findings, making this a relative measure (coverage relative to peers), not an absolute measure.

# Phase 4: Report & Learn

## 4.1: Generate Report

### Execution Summary

**Path Taken:** PATH B (Surgical Deep Dive)

**Reason for Escalation:** THEORY_VIOLATION (recall estimation claims) and CONTRADICTION (independence assumption for synergy) flags were set during Phase 2 threat scan.

**Attack Clusters Applied:**
1. Theoretical Impossibility Cluster (#153, #154, #109, #71)
2. Contradiction Resolution Cluster (#108, #161, #158, #116)

### Findings Summary

#### CRITICAL Findings (must fix)
*None identified*

#### IMPORTANT Findings (should fix)

| ID | Finding | Method | Recommendation |
|----|---------|--------|----------------|
| F001 | Recall estimation provides only a lower bound, not actual recall. The "crossMethodRecallEstimate" name is misleading. | #153 | Rename to "detectedMissRate" or "crossMethodCoverage" and document limitations. |
| F002 | Comment states "P(A and B)" but formula calculates "P(A or B)" for synergy baseline. Semantic confusion. | #153 | Correct comment to "P(A or B)" and clarify what "combinedEffectiveness" represents. |
| F006 | Synergy detection does not control for confounding variables (artifact difficulty, verifier skill, selection bias). | #109 | Document limitation or propose stratified analysis by context variables. |
| F007 | Effectiveness metrics assume human confirmation equals ground truth. No inter-rater reliability mechanism. | #71 | Add confirmation variance tracking or acknowledge limitation in design assumptions. |

#### MINOR Findings (can defer)

| ID | Finding | Method | Recommendation |
|----|---------|--------|----------------|
| F003 | F1 Score uses estimated recall without qualification in the metric name. | #154 | Consider renaming to "estimatedF1" or adding documentation. |
| F004 | Hashed paths preserve structure (depth, extensions) that could aid re-identification. | #154 | Evaluate if full obfuscation is needed based on threat model. |
| F005 | Context normalization for artifact complexity is deferred (Assumption #8). | #109 | Plan for future implementation to enable fair cross-complexity comparisons. |
| F008 | Warning integration with dashboard UI not explicitly specified. | #161 | Ensure warnings are prominently displayed alongside metrics. |
| F009 | Cross-method recall estimation has circular dependency on peer methods. | #116 | Document that recall is relative to peer coverage, not absolute. |

---

### Final Verdict

**NEEDS REVISION**

The artifact is a well-structured technical design with appropriate architectural patterns. However, it has important issues in its statistical methodology claims that could mislead users:

1. The recall estimation methodology does not deliver what the name implies (4 IMPORTANT findings)
2. Statistical comments have technical errors (synergy formula comment)
3. Confounding variables in synergy detection are not addressed
4. Human confirmation is assumed equivalent to ground truth without calibration

Recommended actions before implementation:
1. Revise metric naming to accurately reflect what is measured
2. Fix the P(A and B) vs P(A or B) comment error
3. Document limitations of synergy detection
4. Consider inter-rater reliability tracking

# Appendix: Evidence References

## Quoted Evidence from Artifact

**Evidence for F001 (Recall estimation):**
Lines 339-344:
```typescript
private estimateRecall(methodId: string, records: MethodFindingRecord[]): number {
  // Recall estimation is tricky - we don't know true FN
  // Use cross-method comparison: if another method found issue this one missed
  // This is an estimate, not true recall
  return this.crossMethodRecallEstimate(methodId, records);
}
```

**Evidence for F002 (Synergy formula comment):**
Lines 673-674:
```typescript
// Independence assumption: P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)
```
The formula P + Q - PQ is actually P(A OR B), not P(A AND B).

**Evidence for F006 (Confounding variables):**
Lines 733-747 show comparison of "bothSessions" vs "onlyM1" and "onlyM2" without controlling for any context variables.

**Evidence for F007 (Human confirmation assumption):**
Line 1062 (Assumption #4):
```
User Feedback Availability: Confirmation/rejection data comes from explicit user feedback; no automated ground truth.
```
