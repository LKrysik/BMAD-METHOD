# PHASE 0: TRIAGE & SIGNATURE (Single Pass)

## 0.1: Unified Profile & Signature Extraction

Analyzing artifact to extract its core signature in a single pass.

### Artifact Profile
- **Type**: Design/Architecture Document (technical specification)
- **Complexity Score**: HIGH
  - Rationale: Multi-component system with ML models, statistical analysis, time-series data, and distributed services
- **Criticality Score**: HIGH
  - Rationale: This system tracks method effectiveness and drives automated recommendations - incorrect recommendations could compound errors in verification processes
- **Primary Domain(s)**:
  - Machine Learning (ML-based recommendation engine)
  - Statistics/Data Science (statistical analysis, significance testing)
  - Software Architecture (component design, data models)
  - Privacy/Data Governance (data handling, anonymization)

### Problem Signature

#### Core Claims:
1. **"Data-driven system to track method effectiveness and learn optimal method combinations"** - The system claims to learn what works and recommend accordingly
2. **"Privacy-preserving design"** - Claims to never collect user identity or task content while still providing useful analytics
3. **"Statistical significance" ensures quality** - Claims that significance requirements (30+ usages, p-values) guarantee valid conclusions

# PHASE 1: INNATE THREAT SCAN & ROUTING

## 1.1: Risk Vector Calculation

Analyzing the Triage & Signature Checkpoint to set risk flags.

### Risk Vector Analysis

| Risk Vector | Detected? | Evidence from Signature |
|---|---|---|
| THEORY_VIOLATION | **Y** | Causality assumption (#5: "Method use causes findings") contradicts acknowledged selection bias (Limitation #2: "Selection bias in what methods get used"). Cannot establish causality under selection bias without experimental design (e.g., RCT). The synergy formula derivation also assumes independence which may not hold. |
| CONTRADICTION | **Y** | Privacy claim ("never collect user identity/task content") vs. collecting "Session metadata" that includes method sequences which could be fingerprinting vectors. Additionally, "Independence" assumption (#1) conflicts with the synergy learning which explicitly models method dependencies. |
| SECURITY_CRITICAL | N | No cryptographic claims or security-sensitive operations beyond standard privacy concerns |
| HIGH_COMPLEXITY | **Y** | Complexity Score is HIGH - multi-component ML system |

## 1.2: Path Selection (Routing)

**Decision Logic Applied:**
- THEORY_VIOLATION = Y --> Triggers Path B
- CONTRADICTION = Y --> Triggers Path B
- SECURITY_CRITICAL = N
- HIGH_COMPLEXITY = Y --> Would add optional method to Path A, but Path B takes precedence

**Routing Decision:** PATH B (Surgical Deep Dive)

**Reason:** THEORY_VIOLATION flag was set based on the causality assumption contradiction with acknowledged selection bias. Additionally, CONTRADICTION flag was set due to the privacy vs. metadata collection conflict and the independence vs. synergy learning conflict.

## ATTACK CLUSTER EXECUTION

### Method #153: Theoretical Consistency Check

**Focus:** Does the system's theoretical foundation hold together?

**Analysis:**

1. **Synergy Formula Theoretical Basis:**
   ```
   Synergy = P(finding | A and B) / (P(finding | A) + P(finding | B))
   ```

   **Issue:** This formula has a theoretical error. The expected independent probability should be:
   ```
   P_independent = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B)  [Union formula]
   ```
   But this is NOT what the code computes. The code divides by the raw sum `p_a + p_b`, not the union probability. Furthermore, for synergy measurement, the standard approach would compare:
   ```
   Synergy = P(finding | A and B) / [P(finding | A) * P(finding | B)]
   ```
   for truly independent events, or against the expected union probability.

   The code mixes paradigms - it computes `expected_independent = p_a + p_b - p_a * p_b` correctly for union, but this measures something different than synergy. Synergy typically measures multiplicative improvement over independence, not additive.

2. **EffectivenessModel Feature Independence:**
   The model uses features like `historical_precision` and `usages` together, but historical_precision is DERIVED from usages. This creates collinearity and potential data leakage within the feature set.

3. **Time-based Split Logic:**
   ```python
   split_idx = int(len(X) * 0.8)
   X_train, y_train = X[:split_idx], y[:split_idx]
   ```
   This assumes X is already sorted by time, but the code does not show sorting. The `_prepare_data` method iterates sessions without explicit time ordering.

**FINDING T153-1:** Synergy formula is theoretically inconsistent - mixes union probability logic with synergy interpretation.
**Severity:** HIGH
**Type:** THEORETICAL_ERROR

**FINDING T153-2:** Feature collinearity between precision and usages creates model instability.
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Type:** DESIGN_FLAW

**FINDING T153-3:** Time-based split may not function correctly without explicit sorting.
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Type:** IMPLEMENTATION_GAP

---

### Method #154: Impossibility Proof Analysis

**Focus:** Are any claims provably impossible to achieve?

**Analysis:**

1. **Causality from Observational Data:**

   Assumption #5 states: "Method use causes findings (not correlation only)"

   This is **provably impossible** to establish from the observational data collection described. The system:
   - Has no randomized assignment of methods
   - Acknowledges selection bias exists
   - Has no instrumental variables or natural experiments

   Under these conditions, causal inference is not possible without strong additional assumptions (e.g., no unmeasured confounders) that are not stated or defended.

2. **True Recall Measurement:**

   Limitation #1 correctly states: "Cannot measure true recall (unknown unknowns)"

   This creates an **asymmetric quality metric** - the system optimizes for precision but cannot verify it's not missing critical findings. Methods that find rare-but-critical issues may be deprioritized.

3. **Privacy + Fingerprinting:**

   The combination of:
   - Method IDs used (sequence)
   - Session metadata
   - Task type + domain + complexity

   Creates a fingerprinting vector that could potentially re-identify users despite "never collecting user identity." This is a known privacy research result - sufficient behavioral metadata enables re-identification.

**FINDING T154-1:** Causal inference claim is impossible under the described observational design with selection bias.
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Type:** IMPOSSIBILITY

**FINDING T154-2:** Precision-only optimization without recall creates systematic blind spots for rare critical issues.
**Severity:** HIGH
**Type:** DESIGN_LIMITATION

**FINDING T154-3:** Privacy guarantees may be weaker than claimed due to fingerprinting potential.
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Type:** PRIVACY_GAP

---

### Method #109: Assumption Validity Analysis

**Focus:** Are the stated assumptions valid and complete?

**Analysis of Each Assumption:**

1. **"Independence: Sessions are independent samples"**

   **INVALID:** If the same user/team uses the system repeatedly, sessions are not independent. Learning effects, domain expertise evolution, and method familiarity all create dependencies. Additionally, if the recommendation engine is active, later sessions are influenced by earlier session outcomes - creating direct statistical dependence.

2. **"Stationarity: Method effectiveness stable (short term)"**

   **PARTIALLY VALID:** Reasonable for short windows, but the 90-day baseline in drift detection contradicts this. More importantly, if the codebase being analyzed evolves, method effectiveness could shift rapidly (e.g., new security patterns).

3. **"Observability: Finding confirmation is accurate"**

   **QUESTIONABLE:** The design shows findings can be "confirmed" or "rejected" but doesn't specify by whom or what criteria. Confirmation quality varies by reviewer (Limitation #3) - but this undermines the entire metric foundation.

4. **"Representativeness: Data reflects typical usage"**

   **LIKELY INVALID:** Early adopters typically have different usage patterns. Selection bias (Limitation #2) already acknowledged. No stratification or weighting discussed.

5. **"Causality: Method use causes findings"**

   **INVALID:** Already addressed in T154-1. Cannot be established from this design.

**FINDING T109-1:** Independence assumption is violated by recommendation feedback loops and user learning effects.
**Severity:** HIGH
**Type:** ASSUMPTION_VIOLATION

**FINDING T109-2:** Finding confirmation process lacks rigor specification - garbage in, garbage out risk.
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Type:** SPECIFICATION_GAP

**FINDING T109-3:** Representativeness assumption likely invalid without mitigation strategies.
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Type:** ASSUMPTION_VIOLATION

---

### Method #71: Logical Soundness Verification

**Focus:** Is the logical structure of the design sound?

**Analysis:**

1. **Circular Dependency in Recommendations:**

   ```
   Methods recommended --> Methods get used --> Performance data collected -->
   Methods scored --> Methods recommended...
   ```

   This creates a **winner-takes-all feedback loop**. Methods recommended early will accumulate data, improving their confidence scores, leading to more recommendations. Methods not recommended early will remain in "cold start" forever.

   The exploration bonus in cold start (Section 9.1) partially addresses this but the magnitude isn't specified. Without strong exploration forcing, the system converges to local optima.

2. **Precision vs. Yield Optimization Conflict:**

   The model optimizes for `P(finding | method, context)` - the probability of ANY confirmed finding. But the recommendation blending uses `historical_precision` (confirmed/generated).

   These optimize different things:
   - High yield method: Always finds something (even minor)
   - High precision method: Only triggers on real issues (may miss some)

   The current blending doesn't distinguish - a method with 100% precision on 5 critical findings looks worse than one with 90% precision on 50 trivial findings.

3. **Monitoring Threshold Logic:**

   Model AUC alert threshold is 0.55. This is barely above random (0.50). By the time AUC drops to 0.55, the model has been making near-random recommendations for a significant period. A more aggressive threshold (e.g., 0.65-0.70) would be appropriate.

**FINDING T71-1:** Winner-takes-all feedback loop in recommendations will cause convergence to local optima.
**Severity:** HIGH
**Type:** DESIGN_FLAW

**FINDING T71-2:** Precision/yield conflation fails to distinguish finding severity or importance.
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Type:** DESIGN_GAP

**FINDING T71-3:** AUC monitoring threshold of 0.55 is dangerously permissive.
**Severity:** LOW
**Type:** CONFIGURATION_ISSUE

---

## Additional Analysis: CONTRADICTION Attack (Overlay)

Given the CONTRADICTION flag, applying selective elements of the contradiction cluster:

### Definition Conflicts:

1. **"Privacy-preserving" vs. Metadata Collection:**
   - Section 1.2 claims "Privacy-preserving design"
   - Section 8.1 shows "Session metadata: Yes, Anonymized, 30 days"
   - Method sequence + context + timing is sufficient for de-anonymization

   **FINDING C-1:** Privacy claim potentially misleading given metadata collection scope.
   **Severity:** MEDIUM
   **Type:** CONTRADICTION

2. **"Statistical Significance" inconsistency:**
   - Section 6.1 requires 30 usages for method precision
   - Section 4.2 synergy function returns 1.0 for <20 joint usages (different threshold)
   - Cold start (Section 9) uses "category average as prior" for <30 usages

   These inconsistent thresholds create unpredictable behavior at boundaries.

   **FINDING C-2:** Inconsistent significance thresholds (20 vs 30) create boundary behavior issues.
   **Severity:** LOW
   **Type:** INCONSISTENCY

## 3.3: Learning Extraction (#150)

### Was Path B appropriate?
**YES** - Path B was correctly triggered. The artifact contained:
- A provably impossible causal inference claim (CRITICAL)
- Multiple theoretical/mathematical errors
- Significant assumption violations

Path A would have missed these fundamental issues.

### Trigger Calibration Assessment:
- THEORY_VIOLATION trigger: **Correctly fired** - Causality claim + selection bias acknowledgment was the right signal
- CONTRADICTION trigger: **Correctly fired** - Privacy contradiction was real, though less severe than expected
- The signature extraction correctly identified the core tensions

### Method Effectiveness Notes:
- **#154 (Impossibility Proof):** Highest value - identified the CRITICAL finding
- **#153 (Theoretical Consistency):** High value - found mathematical error in synergy formula
- **#109 (Assumption Validity):** High value - systematically challenged each assumption
- **#71 (Logical Soundness):** Medium-high value - found feedback loop issue

### Recommendations for method_scores.yaml:
- #154 precision: INCREASE (found genuine impossibility)
- #153 precision: INCREASE (found real formula error)
- #109 precision: MAINTAIN (good systematic coverage)
- #71 precision: MAINTAIN (found design flaw but some minor findings)

# VERIFICATION COMPLETE

**Overall Assessment:** The Method Effectiveness Tracker architecture has a **fundamentally flawed foundation** due to its causal inference claims being impossible under the described observational design. Additionally, the synergy formula contains a mathematical error, and multiple stated assumptions are violated by the system's own design (particularly the feedback loop between recommendations and data collection).

**Recommendation:** Before implementation, the design requires:
1. Explicit acknowledgment that correlational insights (not causal) are provided
2. Correction of the synergy formula mathematics
3. Addition of explicit exploration mechanisms to prevent winner-takes-all convergence
4. Re-evaluation of privacy claims given metadata collection scope
5. Specification of finding confirmation rigor standards
