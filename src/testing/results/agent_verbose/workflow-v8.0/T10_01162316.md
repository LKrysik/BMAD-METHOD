## Execution Date: 2026-01-16 23:16
## Workflow Version: V8.0 (Surgical Precision)

---

# PHASE 0: TRIAGE & SIGNATURE (Single Pass)

**Goal:** Profile the artifact and extract its core "signature" in the most token-efficient way possible.

## 0.1: Unified Profile & Signature Extraction

### Artifact Profile
- **Type**: Technical Design Document (spec/plan)
- **Complexity Score**: HIGH
  - Rationale: Multi-component system with 8 distinct requirements, complex TypeScript interfaces, multiple subsystems (normalization, comparison, resolution, reporting), and scalability considerations
- **Criticality Score**: MEDIUM
  - Rationale: Internal tooling for workflow comparison; not security-critical but important for verification reliability
- **Primary Domain(s)**:
  - Software Architecture
  - Distributed Systems (parallel processing, consistency)
  - Data Structures & Algorithms (R-tree indexing, vector embeddings)
  - Information Retrieval (semantic similarity, normalization)

### Problem Signature
- **Core Claims**:
  1. "Scale to 5+ workflows without exponential complexity" - Claims O(n * f * log(f)) vs naive O(n^2 * f^2)
  2. "Correctly identify true contradictions with >95% accuracy"
  3. "Determine authoritative result when conflicts exist through composite resolution"

- **Core Tensions**:
  1. **Granularity vs Comparability**: Workflows with different granularity levels (document/section/paragraph/sentence/token) need alignment; disaggregation introduces uncertainty, aggregation loses precision
  2. **Semantic Comparison Accuracy vs Performance**: Deep semantic analysis requires embeddings and vector comparison, but this adds computational overhead
  3. **Automation vs Human Judgment**: Authority resolution aims to be automated, but some conflicts may genuinely require human review

- **Keywords**: consistency, contradiction, normalization, granularity, authority resolution, semantic similarity, R-tree, vector index, composite scoring, pairwise comparison, scalability, threshold, consolidation

# PHASE 1: THREAT SCAN & ROUTING

**Goal:** Use the signature to detect "red flags" and route the artifact to the correct analysis path.

## 1.1: Risk Vector Calculation

| Risk Vector | Detected? (Y/N) | Evidence from Signature |
|---|---|---|
| THEORY_VIOLATION | N | No claims against known impossibility theorems (FLP, CAP, Halting, etc.). The scalability claim O(n*f*log(f)) is achievable with proper indexing - not a theoretical impossibility. |
| CONTRADICTION | Y | **Tension identified**: The design claims to handle "granularity mismatch" through aggregation/disaggregation, but disaggregation is acknowledged to "mark findings as coarse-grained, add uncertainty" - this creates potential false negatives in contradiction detection. The claim of ">95% accuracy" may conflict with unavoidable granularity uncertainty. |
| SECURITY_CRITICAL | N | Domain is internal tooling (workflow comparison), not crypto, authentication, or security-critical infrastructure. |
| HIGH_COMPLEXITY | Y | Complexity Score is HIGH. Multiple interacting subsystems, sophisticated algorithms (R-tree, vector indexing), and 8 requirements to satisfy simultaneously. |

## 1.2: Path Selection (Routing)

**Routing Decision:** Path B (Surgical Deep Dive)

**Reason:** CONTRADICTION flag was set based on the tension between claimed accuracy (>95%) and acknowledged granularity uncertainty. This requires deeper investigation to determine if this is a fixable gap or a fundamental limitation of the approach.

---

# PHASE 2: ADAPTIVE RESPONSE (Execution)

## PATH B: Surgical Deep Dive (Escalation)

**Triggering Flag:** CONTRADICTION

**Selected Attack Cluster:** Methods #108, #161, #158, #116
- #108 Coincidentia Oppositorum - Find contradictory requirements and seek synthesis or identify impossibility
- #161 Definition Triad Expansion - Extract MEANS/IMPLIES/EXCLUDES for each requirement
- #158 Pairwise Compatibility Matrix - Systematic detection of conflicts between requirements
- #116 Strange Loop Detection - Build justification graph and detect cycles

---

## Method #108: Coincidentia Oppositorum

**Objective:** Find seemingly contradictory requirements and seek higher-level synthesis OR identify as definitionally impossible.

### Analysis

**Candidate Contradiction 1: Granularity Handling vs Accuracy Claims**

- **Requirement A (Success Criteria):** ">95% accuracy in identifying true contradictions"
- **Requirement B (Granularity Handling):** "Handle workflows with different granularity levels"
- **Requirement C (Implementation detail):** Disaggregation "marks findings as coarse-grained, add uncertainty"

**Examination:**
- When comparing a document-level finding from Workflow A with a sentence-level finding from Workflow B, the system must either:
  1. Disaggregate: But disaggregation adds uncertainty (`locationUncertainty` field), and the code explicitly states `granularityMismatch: true` which triggers `comparison.consistencyScore *= this.granularityPenalty(f1, f2)` - reducing confidence
  2. Aggregate: Loss of precision in sentence-level findings

**Is this DEFINITIONALLY impossible?**
- No, this is NOT definitionally impossible. It is a practical engineering challenge.
- The design correctly handles this by:
  - Propagating uncertainty metadata
  - Applying granularity penalties to consistency scores
  - The 95% accuracy claim likely applies to same-granularity comparisons or needs qualification

**Synthesis/Resolution:** The design should EXPLICITLY state that the 95% accuracy claim applies under specific conditions (e.g., "95% accuracy for same-granularity comparisons" or "95% after granularity alignment with documented uncertainty bounds").

---

**Candidate Contradiction 2: Semantic Comparison Accuracy vs O(n*f*log(f)) Scalability**

- **Claim A:** "Semantic similarity using embedding comparison" for accurate comparison
- **Claim B:** "O(n * f * log(f))" time complexity achieved through indexing

**Examination:**
- Embedding generation is O(f) assuming pre-computed embeddings
- Vector index nearest-neighbor search is O(log(f)) with proper indexing (e.g., HNSW, Annoy)
- This IS achievable together

**Is this DEFINITIONALLY impossible?**
- No. Modern approximate nearest neighbor algorithms achieve sub-linear search time while maintaining high recall. The design correctly proposes using spatial (R-tree) and semantic (vector) indices.

**Verdict:** NOT A CONTRADICTION. Technically sound.

---

**Candidate Contradiction 3: Automation vs "requireHumanReview" Flag**

- **Claim A:** System determines authoritative result automatically
- **Feature B:** Configuration includes `requireHumanReview: boolean` and `humanReviewThreshold: number`

**Examination:**
- The design acknowledges that some contradictions may exceed automated resolution confidence
- The `humanReviewThreshold` acts as an escape valve when resolution confidence is below threshold

**Is this DEFINITIONALLY impossible?**
- No. This is good design - acknowledging automation limits and providing human escalation path.

**Verdict:** NOT A CONTRADICTION. Well-designed hybrid approach.

### Method #108 Findings

| Finding ID | Type | Severity | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| M108-F1 | Specification Gap | MEDIUM | The 95% accuracy claim lacks qualification for cross-granularity comparisons. The design correctly handles granularity mismatch with uncertainty propagation, but the success criteria should explicitly bound this claim. |

---

## Method #161: Definition Triad Expansion

**Objective:** For each requirement extract MEANS (literal), IMPLIES (logical consequence), EXCLUDES (incompatible).

### Requirement 1: Run Multiple Workflows on Same Content

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Execute N workflows in parallel/sequential/hybrid mode on identical content |
| **IMPLIES** | - Workflows must be independent (one's execution doesn't affect another) <br> - Content must be immutable during execution <br> - Results must be collectable from all workflows |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Workflows that modify content during execution <br> - Sequential-only workflows that require output from previous workflow |

### Requirement 2: Compare Results for Consistency

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Analyze normalized findings from multiple workflows to determine agreement/disagreement |
| **IMPLIES** | - Common normalization schema exists <br> - Semantic similarity can be computed <br> - Location overlap can be determined |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Workflows with completely incomparable output formats <br> - Non-deterministic workflows where same input produces different findings |

### Requirement 3: Flag Contradictions Between Workflow Findings

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Identify and report when workflows reach opposite conclusions about same issue |
| **IMPLIES** | - System can distinguish "opposite conclusions" from "different conclusions about different things" <br> - Semantic understanding of finding content <br> - Location alignment for same-issue determination |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Treating all disagreements as contradictions <br> - Treating non-overlapping findings as contradictions |

### Requirement 4: Determine Authoritative Result When Conflicts Exist

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Select one finding as "correct" when multiple findings contradict |
| **IMPLIES** | - Authority ranking exists for workflows <br> - Confidence scoring exists for findings <br> - Resolution strategy can be applied programmatically <br> - Some form of "ground truth" proxy (authority weights, confidence, evidence quality) |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Leaving all contradictions unresolved <br> - Requiring human resolution for every contradiction |

### Requirement 5: Handle Workflows with Different Granularity Levels

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Compare document-level findings with sentence-level findings meaningfully |
| **IMPLIES** | - Aggregation of fine-grained to coarse-grained is possible <br> - Disaggregation adds uncertainty <br> - Comparison scope must be aligned before comparison |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Requiring all workflows to produce same-granularity findings <br> - Direct comparison without alignment |

### Requirement 6: Support Configurable Consistency Thresholds

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Allow users to adjust what counts as agreement/contradiction/neutral |
| **IMPLIES** | - Thresholds are numeric and comparable <br> - Different thresholds may be appropriate for different use cases <br> - Validation that thresholds make sense (e.g., agreementThreshold > contradictionThreshold) |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Hard-coded thresholds <br> - Single threshold for all finding types |

### Requirement 7: Generate Consolidated View of All Workflow Results

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Produce unified report showing agreements, contradictions, unique findings, and resolutions |
| **IMPLIES** | - Findings can be grouped by status <br> - Resolution details are preserved <br> - Source workflows are tracked |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Showing only raw workflow outputs <br> - Losing resolution reasoning |

### Requirement 8: Scale to 5+ Workflows Without Exponential Complexity

| Aspect | Content |
|--------|---------|
| **MEANS** | Time complexity must be polynomial (ideally sub-quadratic) in number of workflows and findings |
| **IMPLIES** | - Indexing structures (R-tree, vector index) <br> - Avoiding O(f^2) pairwise comparisons through candidate filtering <br> - Parallel processing for throughput |
| **EXCLUDES** | - Naive all-pairs comparison <br> - Algorithms that scale as O(n^2 * f^2) |

### Method #161 Findings

| Finding ID | Type | Severity | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| M161-F1 | Assumption Gap | LOW | Requirement 1 IMPLIES workflow independence, but the Assumptions section (assumption #4) states this explicitly. Good. |
| M161-F2 | Assumption Gap | MEDIUM | Requirement 2 IMPLIES deterministic workflows (assumption #5), but this assumption may not hold for AI-based workflows. The design should address how to handle non-deterministic workflow outputs. |
| M161-F3 | Implicit Requirement | LOW | Requirement 6 IMPLIES threshold validation (agreementThreshold > contradictionThreshold), but no explicit validation code is shown. |

---

## Method #158: Pairwise Compatibility Matrix

**Objective:** For N requirements construct N x N matrix to systematically detect conflicts.

### Compatibility Matrix (8 Requirements)

|     | R1 | R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 | R7 | R8 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| R1  | -  | C  | C  | C  | C  | C  | C  | ? |
| R2  | C  | -  | C  | C  | ? | C  | C  | ? |
| R3  | C  | C  | -  | C  | ? | C  | C  | C |
| R4  | C  | C  | C  | -  | C  | C  | C  | C |
| R5  | C  | ? | ? | C  | -  | C  | C  | ? |
| R6  | C  | C  | C  | C  | C  | -  | C  | C |
| R7  | C  | C  | C  | C  | C  | C  | -  | C |
| R8  | ? | ? | C  | C  | ? | C  | C  | -  |

**Legend:** C = Compatible, X = Conflict, ? = Unknown/Needs Investigation

### Investigation of Unknown Pairs

**R1 vs R8 (?):** Running multiple workflows in parallel vs scalability
- R1 implies potentially concurrent execution
- R8 requires sub-exponential complexity
- **Investigation:** The `ParallelExecutor` manages resource limits through `maxConcurrency`. The complexity claim applies to the comparison phase, not execution phase. Execution is O(n) in workflows.
- **Verdict:** COMPATIBLE. The parallelism is bounded by configuration.

**R2 vs R5 (?):** Compare results for consistency vs different granularity levels
- Comparing requires normalized findings
- Different granularities complicate normalization
- **Investigation:** The `GranularityAligner` handles this by aligning to common scope before comparison. Penalty factors adjust confidence.
- **Verdict:** COMPATIBLE with caveats (uncertainty propagation).

**R3 vs R5 (?):** Flag contradictions vs different granularity levels
- Contradiction detection requires "same issue" determination
- Granularity mismatch may make "same issue" determination unreliable
- **Investigation:** The design uses `locationOverlap` combined with `semanticSimilarity`. For mismatched granularities, `granularityAdjusted = true` and scores are penalized. This may cause false negatives (missing real contradictions) rather than false positives.
- **Verdict:** COMPATIBLE but with potential ACCURACY DEGRADATION for cross-granularity comparisons.

**R5 vs R8 (?):** Handle different granularities vs scalability
- Granularity alignment involves transformations (aggregate/disaggregate)
- These transformations add computational overhead
- **Investigation:** Aggregation is O(f) - grouping findings by location. Disaggregation is O(1) per finding - just metadata marking. Neither breaks the O(n * f * log(f)) bound.
- **Verdict:** COMPATIBLE.

**R2 vs R8 (?):** Compare results for consistency vs scalability
- Consistency comparison could be O(f^2) naive
- Scalability requires sub-quadratic
- **Investigation:** The design explicitly addresses this with R-tree and vector indices, achieving O(f * log(f)) for candidate filtering. Only candidates (k << f) are compared in detail.
- **Verdict:** COMPATIBLE - this is the core scalability innovation.

### Method #158 Findings

| Finding ID | Type | Severity | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| M158-F1 | Design Tension | MEDIUM | R3 (contradiction detection) + R5 (granularity handling) creates accuracy degradation scenario. The design handles this with penalty factors but should document expected accuracy reduction for cross-granularity cases. |
| M158-F2 | Verification | LOW | All requirement pairs are ultimately compatible. No definitional conflicts found. |

---

## Method #116: Strange Loop Detection

**Objective:** Build justification graph and detect cycles - each cycle needs external anchor or reasoning is ungrounded.

### Justification Graph Construction

**Claim Nodes:**
- C1: System achieves >95% accuracy
- C2: Semantic comparison works for finding comparison
- C3: Authority resolution produces correct results
- C4: Granularity alignment preserves comparison validity
- C5: Scalability claim O(n*f*log(f)) holds
- C6: Consolidated view accurately represents cross-workflow findings

**Justification Edges:**
- C1 <- C2 (accuracy depends on semantic comparison working)
- C1 <- C4 (accuracy depends on granularity alignment)
- C2 <- "embeddings capture semantic meaning" (EXTERNAL ANCHOR: NLP/ML research)
- C3 <- "authority weights are correctly configured" (EXTERNAL ANCHOR: user configuration)
- C3 <- "confidence scores are meaningful" (EXTERNAL ANCHOR: workflow quality)
- C4 <- "aggregation preserves essential information" (CIRCULAR? - depends on what "essential" means)
- C5 <- "R-tree and vector indices achieve O(log n)" (EXTERNAL ANCHOR: data structure theory)
- C6 <- C1 (consolidated view accuracy depends on underlying comparison accuracy)
- C6 <- C3 (consolidated view depends on resolution correctness)

### Cycle Detection

**Potential Cycle 1:** C1 <- C4 <- C1?
- Does C4 depend on C1? Let me check...
- C4 (granularity alignment preserves validity) is justified by aggregation/disaggregation algorithms
- C4 does NOT directly depend on C1
- **Verdict:** NOT A CYCLE

**Potential Cycle 2:** Consolidated View
- C6 <- C1 <- C2 <- embeddings (GROUNDED)
- C6 <- C1 <- C4 <- aggregation algorithms (GROUNDED in algorithm correctness)
- C6 <- C3 <- authority weights (GROUNDED in configuration)
- **Verdict:** NOT A CYCLE - properly grounded in external anchors

### External Anchors Identified

1. **NLP/ML research:** Justifies that embeddings capture semantic meaning
2. **Data structure theory:** Justifies O(log n) index operations
3. **User configuration:** Justifies authority weights being appropriate
4. **Workflow quality:** Justifies confidence scores being meaningful

### Ungrounded Assumptions Found

**Ungrounded #1:** "Aggregation preserves essential information"
- The design assumes that when aggregating fine-grained findings, the important information is preserved
- This depends on the aggregation strategy (`dominantCategory`, `mergeDescriptions`, `aggregateSeverity`)
- **Risk:** If aggregation loses critical distinctions, comparisons based on aggregated findings may miss real contradictions

**Ungrounded #2:** "Workflows are deterministic" (Assumption #5)
- The design states workflows produce same output for same input
- AI-based workflows (like those using LLMs) are NOT deterministic
- **Risk:** Running same workflow twice might produce different findings, making consistency checking unreliable

### Method #116 Findings

| Finding ID | Type | Severity | Description |
|------------|------|----------|-------------|
| M116-F1 | Ungrounded Assumption | MEDIUM | "Aggregation preserves essential information" is asserted but not proven. The aggregation strategies (dominantCategory, mergeDescriptions) may lose critical distinctions needed for contradiction detection. |
| M116-F2 | Ungrounded Assumption | HIGH | "Workflows are deterministic" (Assumption #5) conflicts with reality for AI/LLM-based workflows. The design should address non-deterministic workflow handling, possibly through multiple execution averaging or confidence bounds. |
| M116-F3 | External Dependency | LOW | The 95% accuracy claim depends on embedding quality, which is an external dependency on NLP/ML model performance. This should be documented as a system dependency. |

## 3.1: Generate Report

### Execution Summary

| Aspect | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Workflow Version** | V8.0 (Surgical Precision) |
| **Path Taken** | B (Surgical Deep Dive) |
| **Triggering Flag** | CONTRADICTION |
| **Methods Used** | #108, #161, #158, #116 |
| **Artifact Type** | Technical Design Document |
| **Artifact Complexity** | HIGH |

### Consolidated Findings

| ID | Severity | Type | Description | Method Source |
|----|----------|------|-------------|---------------|
| F1 | HIGH | Ungrounded Assumption | Assumption #5 ("Workflows are deterministic") conflicts with AI/LLM-based workflows which are inherently non-deterministic. The design provides no mechanism for handling stochastic workflow outputs. | #116 |
| F2 | MEDIUM | Specification Gap | The >95% accuracy success criterion lacks qualification for cross-granularity comparisons where the design explicitly introduces uncertainty penalties and granularity adjustments. | #108 |
| F3 | MEDIUM | Design Tension | Contradiction detection (R3) combined with granularity handling (R5) creates accuracy degradation. The penalty factors address this but expected accuracy bounds are not documented. | #158 |
| F4 | MEDIUM | Ungrounded Assumption | "Aggregation preserves essential information" is asserted but aggregation strategies may lose critical distinctions. No validation mechanism for aggregation quality. | #116 |
| F5 | MEDIUM | Assumption Gap | Determinism assumption may not hold for AI-based workflows. Design should address non-deterministic workflow handling. | #161 |
| F6 | LOW | Implicit Requirement | Threshold validation (agreementThreshold > contradictionThreshold) is implied but no explicit validation code is shown in the configuration system. | #161 |
| F7 | LOW | External Dependency | 95% accuracy claim depends on embedding model quality - an external dependency that should be documented. | #116 |

### Positive Observations

1. **Well-structured architecture:** Clear separation of concerns between execution, normalization, comparison, resolution, and reporting
2. **Scalability properly addressed:** The design correctly identifies naive O(n^2 * f^2) problem and solves it with indexing
3. **Uncertainty propagation:** The design properly propagates granularity uncertainty rather than hiding it
4. **Human escalation path:** The `requireHumanReview` configuration acknowledges automation limits
5. **Comprehensive requirements coverage:** All 8 stated requirements are addressed with specific implementations
6. **Good assumption documentation:** The design explicitly lists 8 assumptions, enabling reviewers to evaluate them

## 3.2: Learning Extraction (#150)

### Method Effectiveness Assessment

| Method | Effectiveness | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| #108 Coincidentia Oppositorum | HIGH | Effectively identified that the accuracy-vs-granularity tension is practical not definitional. Confirmed no fundamental impossibilities. |
| #161 Definition Triad Expansion | MEDIUM | Useful for systematic requirement analysis but findings were relatively minor. Most value in confirming explicit assumptions. |
| #158 Pairwise Compatibility Matrix | HIGH | Systematic coverage ensured no requirement pair was missed. Identified R3+R5 tension. |
| #116 Strange Loop Detection | HIGH | Found the most critical issues: determinism assumption conflict and ungrounded aggregation assumption. |

### Workflow Observations

- **Path B was appropriate:** The CONTRADICTION flag correctly identified a real design tension that warranted deeper investigation
- **No false alarm:** All methods contributed substantive findings; escalation was justified
- **Efficiency note:** For a HIGH complexity spec like this, the 4-method attack cluster was appropriately sized

### Recommendations for Future Iterations

1. For technical design documents, #116 (Strange Loop Detection) should be prioritized - it found the highest-severity issue
2. Assumption validation should be a standard part of spec verification
3. When "accuracy" claims appear without qualification, this should trigger CONTRADICTION flag even without explicit tension

# APPENDIX: Detailed Method Trace Logs

## Method #108 Trace

```
INPUT: Core tensions from signature
  - granularity-vs-comparability
  - accuracy-vs-performance
  - automation-vs-judgment

STEP 1: Enumerate candidate contradictions
  - Candidate 1: Granularity handling vs 95% accuracy claim
  - Candidate 2: Semantic comparison vs O(n*f*log(f)) scalability
  - Candidate 3: Automated resolution vs human judgment need

STEP 2: For each candidate, test definitional impossibility
  - Candidate 1: Check if handling different granularities DEFINITIONALLY prevents 95% accuracy
    - Disaggregation adds uncertainty but doesn't make accuracy impossible
    - Aggregation loses precision but can still achieve accuracy for the aggregated level
    - VERDICT: Practical challenge, not definitional impossibility
  - Candidate 2: Check if semantic embeddings conflict with log-time indexing
    - Vector indices (HNSW, Annoy) achieve approximate NN in O(log n)
    - Pre-computing embeddings is O(f)
    - VERDICT: Technically compatible
  - Candidate 3: Check if automation conflicts with human review option
    - Design includes escape valve via humanReviewThreshold
    - VERDICT: Good hybrid design, not a contradiction

STEP 3: Identify synthesis opportunities
  - For Candidate 1: Qualify the 95% claim with conditions

OUTPUT: One finding (M108-F1) about specification gap
```

## Method #116 Trace

```
INPUT: Key claims from artifact

STEP 1: Build claim dependency graph
  Nodes: [C1: accuracy, C2: semantic, C3: resolution, C4: granularity, C5: scalability, C6: consolidated]
  Edges:
    C1 <- C2
    C1 <- C4
    C2 <- EXTERNAL(embeddings)
    C3 <- EXTERNAL(config)
    C3 <- EXTERNAL(workflow quality)
    C4 <- aggregation
    C5 <- EXTERNAL(data structures)
    C6 <- C1
    C6 <- C3

STEP 2: Run DFS for cycle detection
  Path: C1 -> C2 -> EXTERNAL (terminates, no cycle)
  Path: C1 -> C4 -> aggregation -> ? (check if aggregation depends on C1)
    - Aggregation algorithms don't reference accuracy claim
    - No cycle detected

STEP 3: Identify ungrounded nodes
  - "aggregation" node: justified by algorithm but "preserves essential information" is asserted
  - Assumption #5 (determinism): external anchor but conflicts with AI workflow reality

STEP 4: Assess external anchor validity
  - EXTERNAL(embeddings): valid if using proven embedding models
  - EXTERNAL(data structures): valid, well-established theory
  - EXTERNAL(config): valid but depends on correct user configuration
  - EXTERNAL(workflow quality): valid but assumption #5 conflicts with AI workflows

OUTPUT: Three findings (M116-F1, M116-F2, M116-F3)
```

# VERIFICATION COMPLETE

**Overall Assessment:** The artifact is a well-designed technical specification with comprehensive coverage of requirements and good architectural decisions. However, it contains one HIGH severity issue (determinism assumption incompatible with AI workflows) and three MEDIUM severity issues that should be addressed before implementation.

**Recommendation:** Address F1 (determinism assumption) by adding a section on non-deterministic workflow handling, possibly through multiple execution averaging or uncertainty bounds. Qualify the 95% accuracy claim (F2) with conditions. Document expected accuracy degradation for cross-granularity comparisons (F3).
