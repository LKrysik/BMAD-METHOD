## Phase 1: Innate Threat Scan & Routing

### 1.1: Risk Vector Calculation

| Risk Vector | Detected? | Evidence from Signature |
|---|---|---|
| THEORY_VIOLATION | **Y** | Claim "exponential speedup" for QUBO/optimization contradicts: (1) No proven quantum advantage for optimization problems exists, (2) Claims "O(poly(n))" complexity for NP-hard problem, (3) Adiabatic theorem's gap requirement is itself exponentially hard to compute |
| CONTRADICTION | **Y** | Tension between "sub-100ms optimization" and "surface code error correction" which requires thousands of physical qubits and long coherence times; Tension between "99.7% global optimum" guarantee and known hardness of gap estimation |

| HIGH_COMPLEXITY | **Y** | Complexity Score is HIGH - quantum mechanics, error correction, distributed systems |

### 1.2: Path Selection (Routing)

**Routing Decision:** Path B (Surgical Deep Dive)

**Reason:** THEORY_VIOLATION flag was set based on:
1. Claims of "quantum advantage" and "exponential speedup" for optimization problems - no such proven advantage exists
2. Claims of polynomial time complexity O(poly(n)) for what is fundamentally an NP-hard problem
3. Adiabatic theorem guarantees require knowing the spectral gap, which is QMA-complete to estimate

**Triggering Flag for Attack Cluster Selection:** THEORY_VIOLATION (primary), CONTRADICTION (secondary)

**Selected Attack Cluster:** THEORY_VIOLATION cluster
- #153: Theoretical Impossibility Check
- #154: Definitional Contradiction Detector
- #109: Contraposition Inversion
- #71: First Principles Analysis

## Phase 2: Adaptive Response - PATH B (Surgical Deep Dive)

### Method #153: Theoretical Impossibility Check

**Goal:** Check claims against known impossibility theorems.

#### Claim Analysis:

**CLAIM 1:** "Quantum Annealing achieves O(poly(n)) time complexity"

**Theorem Check:**
- **Computational Complexity Theory:** QUBO is NP-hard. There is no proof that quantum computers can solve NP-hard problems in polynomial time. The claim O(poly(n)) would imply NP in BQP, which is an unproven conjecture.
- **Adiabatic Theorem Dependency:** The adiabatic theorem guarantees ground state preparation only if T >> 1/gap_min^2. For NP-hard problems, the minimum spectral gap can be exponentially small, requiring exponential time to maintain adiabaticity.
- **Gap Estimation Hardness:** Computing the spectral gap for a general Hamiltonian is QMA-complete (quantum analog of NP-complete). The artifact's `_estimate_spectral_gap()` function cannot efficiently compute this.

**VERDICT: CRITICAL THEORY VIOLATION**
The claim of polynomial-time quantum annealing for NP-hard problems contradicts established computational complexity bounds.

---

**CLAIM 2:** "Speedup factor S = O(2^n / n^k) ~ 10^40"

**Theorem Check:**
- **No-Free-Lunch Theorem:** For optimization, no algorithm is uniformly better than random search across all problems. The claimed universal 10^40 speedup violates this principle.
- **Quantum Speedup Reality:** The best proven quantum speedup for unstructured search is Grover's algorithm at O(sqrt(N)), a quadratic (not exponential) improvement. For optimization, even this is not always achievable.
- **D-Wave Evidence:** Empirical studies of D-Wave quantum annealers show no consistent quantum speedup over well-tuned classical algorithms for practical QUBO instances.

**VERDICT: CRITICAL THEORY VIOLATION**
The claimed exponential speedup has no theoretical or empirical basis. Published research shows quantum annealers often perform comparably to or worse than classical optimizers.

---

**CLAIM 3:** "Quantum tunneling allows direct traversal through barriers"

**Theorem Check:**
- **Tunneling Rate Reality:** Quantum tunneling probability decreases exponentially with barrier width: P_tunnel ~ exp(-sqrt(height * width)). For tall/wide barriers in hard optimization landscapes, tunneling provides no guaranteed advantage.
- **Freeze-out Problem:** At low temperatures (required for annealing), thermal fluctuations freeze out and tunneling becomes the only mechanism, but tunneling rates become exponentially suppressed for hard problems.

**VERDICT: MISLEADING**
While quantum tunneling exists, its advantage over classical thermal hopping is problem-dependent and not guaranteed.

---

**CLAIM 4:** "99.7% global optimum probability"

**Theorem Check:**
- **Adiabatic Theorem Caveat:** The probability guarantee P >= 1 - O(1/(T*gap_min^2)) holds ONLY if the annealing time T is chosen correctly based on knowing gap_min. For NP-hard problems, this is circular - you need to solve the hard problem to know how long to run.
- **Approximation vs Optimum:** What the artifact likely achieves is a high-quality approximation, NOT a verified global optimum. Without exponential verification, there's no way to confirm optimality.

**VERDICT: CRITICAL - UNVERIFIABLE CLAIM**
The 99.7% figure cannot be verified without solving the NP-hard problem classically to compare.

---

### Method #154: Definitional Contradiction Detector

**Goal:** Find requirements that are DEFINITIONALLY mutually exclusive.

#### Contradiction Analysis:

**CONTRADICTION 1:** "Sub-100ms optimization" vs. "Surface code error correction"

- **Surface Code Reality:** Current surface codes require ~1000-10000 physical qubits per logical qubit, with error correction cycles on the order of microseconds per round, requiring many rounds for fault tolerance.
- **Qubit Requirements:** For n=150 methods (150 binary variables), you need 150 logical qubits. With surface code overhead, this means 150,000-1,500,000 physical qubits.
- **Current Hardware:** The largest quantum computers (as of 2026) have ~1000-10000 qubits, most of which are noisy and not error-corrected.

**DEFINITIONAL CONFLICT:** The artifact requires technology that does not exist. Error-corrected quantum annealing at the scale described is physically impossible with current or near-term hardware.

---

**CONTRADICTION 2:** "Parallel QPU distribution" with "Result aggregation"

- **Quantum Coherence:** Quantum states cannot be simply "aggregated" across independent quantum systems without entanglement, which would require a single coherent quantum system.
- **Classical Aggregation:** The `asyncio.gather(*tasks)` code shows classical parallelization. Multiple independent QPU runs are equivalent to multiple classical simulated annealing runs - no quantum advantage from parallelization.

**DEFINITIONAL CONFLICT:** Classical result aggregation from independent quantum runs provides no quantum advantage over classical parallel optimization.

---

**CONTRADICTION 3:** "Quantum Boltzmann sampling" at specified inverse_temperature

- **Thermal Equilibrium Problem:** Quantum Boltzmann sampling requires the system to thermalize at a specific temperature, which requires time proportional to the gap. The sub-100ms target conflicts with proper thermalization for hard problems.

**DEFINITIONAL CONFLICT:** Fast optimization and proper quantum thermalization are in tension.

---

### Method #109: Contraposition Inversion

**Goal:** Instead of what leads to success, identify what guarantees failure, then check if the artifact does any of those.

#### Failure Path Analysis:

**GUARANTEED FAILURE 1:** Claim polynomial time for NP-hard problem without proof of P=NP or BQP contains NP
- **Artifact Status:** VIOLATED - Claims O(poly(n)) for QUBO

**GUARANTEED FAILURE 2:** Assume quantum speedup without rigorous proof or empirical validation
- **Artifact Status:** VIOLATED - Claims 10^40 speedup with no experimental evidence or theoretical proof

**GUARANTEED FAILURE 3:** Promise adiabatic guarantees without solving gap estimation
- **Artifact Status:** VIOLATED - Uses `_estimate_spectral_gap()` as if it's tractable

**GUARANTEED FAILURE 4:** Conflate quantum-inspired classical algorithms with actual quantum computing
- **Artifact Status:** PARTIALLY VIOLATED - The "graceful degradation" section acknowledges classical fallback, but the overall document conflates quantum claims with classical implementations

**GUARANTEED FAILURE 5:** Promise error correction performance incompatible with current hardware
- **Artifact Status:** VIOLATED - Claims surface code error correction in sub-100ms regime

---

### Method #71: First Principles Analysis

**Goal:** Strip away assumptions and rebuild from fundamental truths.

#### First Principles Reconstruction:

**FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH 1:** QUBO is NP-hard
- **Implication:** No known algorithm (quantum or classical) can solve all QUBO instances in polynomial time unless P=NP or BQP contains NP (both unproven).
- **Artifact Assumption:** Quantum annealing somehow circumvents this hardness.
- **Reality:** Quantum annealing provides a heuristic, not a guaranteed polynomial-time solver.

**FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH 2:** Adiabatic theorem requires gap knowledge
- **Implication:** To guarantee adiabatic evolution stays in ground state, you must know the minimum spectral gap.
- **Artifact Assumption:** Gap can be estimated efficiently (`_estimate_spectral_gap()`).
- **Reality:** Gap estimation for general Hamiltonians is QMA-complete - as hard as the problems quantum computers are meant to solve.

**FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH 3:** Quantum error correction has massive overhead
- **Implication:** Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires thousands of physical qubits per logical qubit.
- **Artifact Assumption:** Error correction can be performed within sub-100ms timeframe for 150+ qubits.
- **Reality:** Such systems do not exist and are not projected for many years.

**FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH 4:** No proven quantum speedup for optimization
- **Implication:** Despite extensive research, quantum annealers have not demonstrated consistent speedups over classical optimization.
- **Artifact Assumption:** Quantum annealing provides exponential speedup.
- **Reality:** The best evidence suggests quantum annealers are competitive with, but not faster than, well-tuned classical algorithms.

**FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH 5:** Method selection is not a critical bottleneck
- **Implication:** Selecting methods from a library of 150 items is easily handled by classical heuristics in milliseconds.
- **Artifact Assumption:** Quantum optimization is needed for this problem.
- **Reality:** The problem is trivially solvable classically. A greedy or genetic algorithm would work instantly.
