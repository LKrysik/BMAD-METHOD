# PHASE 0: Self-Check (MANDATORY)

## 0.1: #113 Counterfactual Self-Incrimination

**Task:** List 3 ways I could be deceptive or cut corners in THIS specific verification.

1. **Surface-level scanning**: I could skim the TypeScript interfaces and Python code snippets without deeply analyzing the mathematical formulas for correctness. Evidence I am NOT doing this: I will trace through each formula (synergy calculation, Wilson score interval, etc.) to verify mathematical soundness.

2. **Ignoring domain complexity**: This artifact involves statistics, ML, and distributed systems concepts. I could pretend to understand them without actually checking domain-specific correctness. Evidence I am NOT doing this: I will explicitly check claims against statistical theory (confidence intervals, A/B testing assumptions) and ML best practices.

3. **Confirmation bias toward "looks professional"**: The artifact is well-formatted with clear sections and code examples. I could conflate presentation quality with content correctness. Evidence I am NOT doing this: I will scrutinize claims independently of formatting, checking if the statistics are actually valid and if assumptions hold.

## 0.2: #131 Observer Paradox

**Question:** Is my planned analysis GENUINE or PERFORMANCE?

**Signs of Performance I should watch for:**
- Generating findings just to show I'm thorough
- Over-emphasizing minor issues while missing fundamental flaws
- Creating a long report without substantive critique

**Assessment:** I commit to GENUINE analysis. I will focus on whether this design would actually work in production, not on appearing thorough. If the artifact is sound, I will say so. If it has fundamental flaws, I will identify them specifically.

## 0.3: #132 Goodhart's Law Check

**Primary metric:** Number of findings generated

**How I could game this:**
- Create multiple low-severity findings from a single underlying issue
- Flag stylistic concerns as substantive issues
- Invent problems where none exist

**Commitment:** I will pursue the actual goal (identifying genuine issues that would impact the system's effectiveness) rather than maximizing finding count. I will consolidate related issues and avoid inventing problems.

# PHASE 1: Triage & Signature (Single Pass)

## 1.1: Unified Profile & Signature Extraction

### Artifact Profile

  2. "Statistical rigor" vs "Cold start problem"
  3. "Privacy preservation" vs "Effectiveness tracking"
- **Keywords**: XGBClassifier, synergy score, Wilson score interval, concept drift, A/B testing, precision, yield, cold start, statistical significance, confidence intervals, p-value

### Triage Checkpoint

# PHASE 2: Innate Threat Scan & Routing

## 2.1: Risk Vector Calculation

| Risk Vector | Detected? | Evidence from Signature |
|---|---|---|
| THEORY_VIOLATION | Y | Claim "predicts probability of method producing confirmed finding" implies statistical guarantees. The synergy formula and ML model make assumptions (independence, stationarity) that are explicitly stated but their violation impact is unclear. The "causality" assumption (Section 10, item 5) is particularly problematic - correlation vs causation is a known impossibility in observational ML. |
| CONTRADICTION | Y | Tension between "min sample 30 usages" for precision (Section 6.1) and "cold start" handling using "category average as prior" (Section 9.1) creates definitional conflict about when to trust vs not trust scores. Also: "Selection bias in what methods get used" (Section 11, item 2) directly undermines the ML model's training data validity. |
| SECURITY_CRITICAL | N | Privacy section exists (Section 8), no obvious security flaws in design. |
| HIGH_COMPLEXITY | Y | Multiple ML/statistics components, drift detection, A/B testing framework. |

## 2.2: Path Selection (Routing)

**Routing Decision:** Path B (Surgical Deep Dive)
**Reason:** THEORY_VIOLATION flag was set based on statistical and causal inference claims that may be theoretically unsound. CONTRADICTION flag was set based on tensions between statistical rigor requirements and cold-start handling.

## 2.3: Prioritized Routing Flags (V8.1)

**PRIORITIZED_FLAGS** (sorted by priority):
1. THEORY_VIOLATION
2. CONTRADICTION

# PHASE 3: Adaptive Response (Execution)

## PATH B: Surgical Deep Dive (Escalation)

### Loading method_scores.yaml

Method scores loaded. Processing attack clusters.

### Processing PRIORITIZED_FLAGS[0]: THEORY_VIOLATION

**Attack Cluster for THEORY_VIOLATION:** #153, #154, #109, #71

**Sorting by effectiveness score** (using document type since artifact is a spec/design):
- #153 (Theoretical Impossibility Check): default 0.50
- #154 (Definitional Contradiction Detector): default 0.50
- #109 (Contraposition Inversion): score 0.70
- #71 (First Principles Analysis): default 0.50

**Sorted order:** #109 (0.70), #153 (0.50), #154 (0.50), #71 (0.50)

### Method #109: Contraposition Inversion

**Question:** Instead of "what leads to success," answer "what guarantees failure" for this effectiveness tracking system.

**Known Guarantees for Failure:**

1. **Selection Bias Guarantee of Failure:**
   - If methods are not randomly assigned but chosen based on perceived effectiveness, the training data is biased
   - The artifact explicitly acknowledges this in Section 11, item 2: "Selection bias in what methods get used"
   - This is NOT adequately addressed - the ML model trains on biased data

2. **Survivorship Bias Guarantee:**
   - Methods that find issues get used more
   - Methods that don't find issues get used less
   - Over time, we only have data on "winners" - cannot tell if losers were actually bad or just unlucky

3. **Confounding Variable Guarantee:**
   - The "causality" assumption (Section 10, item 5) states "Method use causes findings (not correlation only)"
   - This is UNFALSIFIABLE in an observational system - experts choose methods, experts find issues
   - Cannot separate "method effectiveness" from "expert who chose method effectiveness"

**Current Solution Check:**
- Does the artifact do any of these failure-guaranteeing things? YES
- Selection bias: Acknowledged but not mitigated
- Confounding: Assumed away ("Causality" assumption)
- Survivorship: Not addressed

**FINDING F1:**
| ID | Severity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | CRITICAL | THEORY_VIOLATION | The system's core assumption #5 "Method use causes findings (not correlation only)" is unfalsifiable in an observational study. Expert choice confounds method effectiveness. The ML model cannot distinguish "method X is effective" from "experts who choose method X are effective." This is a fundamental limitation of causal inference from observational data (see: Simpson's Paradox, confounding variables). |

**Status:** CRITICAL finding generated.

---

### EARLY EXIT TRIGGERED

Per V8.1 protocol: "If a CRITICAL finding is generated, immediately cease execution of any remaining methods in the current cluster and all subsequent clusters."

**Ceasing further method execution. Proceeding to Phase 4.**

---

# PHASE 4: Report & Learn

## 4.1: Generate Report

### Execution Summary
- **Path Executed:** B (Surgical Deep Dive)
- **Early Exit:** YES - triggered at Method #109 (Contraposition Inversion)
- **Methods Executed:** 1 of 4 in THEORY_VIOLATION cluster
- **Methods Skipped:** #153, #154, #71 (THEORY_VIOLATION cluster) and entire CONTRADICTION cluster (#108, #161, #158, #116)

### Findings

#### CRITICAL Findings

| ID | Description | Method |
|---|---|---|
| F1 | **Unfalsifiable Causality Assumption:** The system assumes "method use causes findings" but operates as an observational study where experts choose methods. Cannot separate method effectiveness from expert effectiveness. This is a fundamental limitation - the ML model will learn expert preferences, not method intrinsic value. Simpson's Paradox and confounding variables make causal claims invalid without randomized experiments. | #109 Contraposition Inversion |

#### Additional Observations (Not from executed methods, but noted during analysis)

While the early exit prevents full analysis, the following issues were noted during initial triage:

| Observation | Impact |
|---|---|
| Selection bias explicitly acknowledged but not mitigated | Training data is non-representative |
| "Cannot measure true recall (unknown unknowns)" acknowledged | Precision metric alone is insufficient |
| Confidence interval requires 30 usages but cold-start uses category average | Inconsistent statistical rigor |

### Final Verdict

**NEEDS REVISION**

The artifact acknowledges important limitations but fails to address the fundamental causal inference problem. A "Method Effectiveness Tracker" that cannot distinguish method effectiveness from user effectiveness is fundamentally flawed in its core purpose. The system will converge to tracking "what experts like" rather than "what actually works."

**Recommended Actions:**
1. Implement randomized method assignment for at least a subset of sessions to enable causal inference
2. Add propensity score matching or instrumental variable approaches to attempt causal inference from observational data
3. Clearly scope claims to "correlation" rather than "effectiveness" if randomization is not feasible
4. Consider A/B testing framework (Section 6.3) as the PRIMARY data source rather than observational data

## 4.2: Learning Extraction (#150)

### Metrics Gathered
- **used_methods:** [109]
- **method_findings:**
  - 109 -> [F1]

### Method Precision Calculation
- Method #109: produced = 1, session_precision = 1.0

### Score Update Calculation
For method #109 (Contraposition Inversion):
- old_score (document): 0.70
- decay_factor: 0.9
- learning_rate: 0.1
- session_precision: 1.0
- new_score = (0.70 * 0.9) + (1.0 * 0.1) = 0.63 + 0.10 = 0.73

**Note:** Score update would be written to method_scores.yaml in production.

### Learning Notes
- Contraposition Inversion (#109) proved highly effective for this artifact
- Early exit at first method demonstrates V8.1's efficiency for artifacts with fundamental flaws
- The causal inference issue is a pattern worth documenting for ML/statistics artifacts

# VERIFICATION COMPLETE

## Summary Statistics
- **Total Methods Executed:** 1
- **Total Findings:** 1 CRITICAL
- **Early Exit:** YES
- **Verdict:** NEEDS REVISION

## Token Efficiency Note
V8.1's early exit mechanism allowed termination after a single method identified a critical flaw, avoiding unnecessary analysis of an artifact with a fundamental design issue.
