### Key Results

| Metric | WF-v7.4 | WF-v7.0 | WF-v8.1 | Delta vs v7.0 |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|---------------|
| **Avg WDS** | **81.1%** | 72.4% | 61.7% | +8.7% |
| **CRITICAL Detection** | **100%** | 91% | 81% | +9% |
| **THEORY Detection** | **100%** | 94% | 88% | +6% |
| **Token Usage** | ~4.3M | ~55K | ~232K | See note* |
| **Efficiency (WDS%/K)** | 0.019 | 1.317 | 0.266 | -99% |

*Note: v7.4 uses Opus 4.5 with extended thinking and parallel subagents, causing significantly higher token usage. The ~4.3M total includes substantial cache read (3.0M) and cache write (1.2M).

**Verdict:** WF-v7.4 achieves **PERFECT CRITICAL detection (100%)** on V3 expert-level theoretical impossibility tasks. The Cognitive Surrogate architecture with extended thinking successfully catches all major theoretical impossibilities including FLP, Halting Problem, Rice's Theorem, Gödel, and Myerson-Satterthwaite.

- **Perfect Critical Focus**: 100% CRITICAL detection rate - ALL major theoretical impossibilities caught
- **Theory Mastery**: 100% detection of THEORY errors
- **Trade-off**: Higher token cost (78x v7.0) for guaranteed critical detection

### Recommendations

**Use WF-v7.4 for:**
- Mission-critical verification requiring 100% CRITICAL detection
- V3 expert-level tasks with theoretical impossibilities
- High-stakes designs where missing impossibilities is unacceptable
- Research/formal verification contexts

**Use WF-v7.0 for:**
- Token-constrained environments (91% CRITICAL at 1/78th cost)
- High-volume routine verification
- When 91% CRITICAL detection is acceptable

**Avoid WF-v7.4 for:**
- Budget-constrained projects
- Simple V1/V2 tasks (overkill)
- Latency-sensitive applications
