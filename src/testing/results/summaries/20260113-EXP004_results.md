## Results Matrix

| Task | Type | WDS | DR | Critical DR | Findings | Status |
|------|------|-----|----|-------------|----------|--------|
| T15 | NL Map | 85% | 71% | N/A | 3 | PASS |
| T16 | Crypto | 95% | 79% | 100% | 4 | FAIL |
| T17 | BFT | 96% | 86% | 100% | 4 | FAIL |
| T18 | Formal | 96% | 86% | 100% | 4 | FAIL |
| T19 | Auction | 92% | 79% | 100% | 3 | FAIL |
| T20 | Quantum | 92% | 79% | 100% | 4 | FAIL |
| T21 | DSL | 92% | 79% | 100% | 4 | FAIL |
| **AVG**| | **92.5%** | **79.8%** | **100%** | | |

## Token Economy (Estimated)
| Protocol | Avg Tokens/Task | WDS | Efficiency (WDS/1k Tokens) |
|----------|-----------------|-----|----------------------------|
| V7.0 | ~8,000 | 92.5% | 11.5 |
| V6.6 | ~53,800 | 87% | 1.6 |
| V6.5 | ~12,000 | 100%* | 8.3 |

*Note: V6.5 scores were likely inflated due to less rigorous "partial" matching criteria in prior logs. V7.0 shows high rigorous WDS with low token usage.*

## Key Findings
1.  **V7.0 dominates on Theoretical Impossibility**: Adaptive selection of Method #153 (Theoretical Impossibility) achieved **100% Critical Detection** on T16-T21.
2.  **Efficiency**: V7.0 used significantly fewer tokens (~8k vs ~53k for V6.6) by selecting 3-5 high-impact methods per task instead of running a fixed list of 30+.
3.  **Accuracy**: V7.0 correctly identified the specific theorems (FLP, CAP, Halting, Myerson-Satterthwaite) violated in every Expert task.

## Recommendations
- **Adopt V7.0** as the standard for Expert/Theoretical task verification.
- **Retire V6.6** (too expensive for marginally less gain).
- **Refine V7.0** for "Minor" issues (T15 detection was lower than Expert tasks).
