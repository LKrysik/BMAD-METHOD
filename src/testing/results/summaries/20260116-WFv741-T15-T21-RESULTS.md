## 1. Effectiveness Analysis

This analysis measures the performance of the specified workflow, executed by the agent, against the ground truth traps defined in `src/testing/tasks/ground-truth.md`.

| Task | Total Errors | Detected (Full) | Detected (Partial) | Missed | Detection Rate (DR) |
|------|--------------|-----------------|--------------------|--------|---------------------|
| T15 | 7 | 1 | 2 | 4 | 32.14% |
| T16 | 6 | 1 | 0 | 5 | 21.43% |
| T17 | 6 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 42.86% |
| T18 | 6 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 35.71% |
| T19 | 6 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 32.14% |
| T20 | 6 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 42.86% |
| T21 | 6 | 2 | 0 | 4 | 42.86% |
| **TOTAL**| **43** | **11** | **3** | **29** | **35.71% (Avg)** |

## 2. Token Economy Analysis

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tokens | N/A |
| Total Cost (USD) | N/A |
| Efficiency (Points/1k Tokens) | N/A |

**Token Analyzer Output:**
```
Token analysis was not performed. The designated script, `session_usage_analyzer.py`, is built specifically for a "Claude" environment and is incompatible with the "Gemini CLI" environment used for this experiment.
```

## 3. Conclusion & Observations

**Effectiveness Summary:**
The overall point-based Detection Rate (DR) across all expert-level tasks was **35.71%**. This result is respectable, as it falls within the 30-50% DR range expected for a `v6.4` workflow against these `V3` tasks, according to the `ground-truth.md` document. The `codebase_investigator` sub-agent demonstrated a notable ability to identify several highly complex theoretical and domain-specific flaws, such as the Halting Problem (T18), contradictions in quantum advantage claims (T20), and soundness issues in programming language design (T21). Furthermore, in several tasks, the agent identified valid issues (related to security, implementation, or ethics) that were not part of the official ground truth, demonstrating a capacity for valuable exploratory analysis.

**Process Observations:**
The `universal-test-orchestrator.md` provides a solid framework for evaluation. However, this execution highlighted two main challenges:
1.  **Tool Incompatibility:** Core parts of the process, specifically the token economy analysis, are dependent on tools (`session_usage_analyzer.py`) designed for a different environment ("Claude") and are not universally compatible.
2.  **Sub-Agent Output:** The `delegate_to_agent` function, used to simulate sub-agent execution, returns a structured JSON summary rather than the detailed, step-by-step trace anticipated by the orchestrator document. This requires an extra layer of interpretation and formatting by the orchestrating agent to generate the final verification reports.

The overall testing process was successful in measuring effectiveness but underscores the need for more environment-agnostic tooling to ensure all phases of the protocol can be executed as designed.
