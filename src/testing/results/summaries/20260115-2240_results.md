## Key Findings

### What V7.1 Does Well
1. **Theoretical impossibility detection** - Correctly identified FLP, Myerson-Satterthwaite, Halting Problem, Rice's Theorem, Godel Incompleteness
2. **Cross-domain expertise** - Effective in crypto, distributed systems, computability, mechanism design, quantum computing, PL theory
3. **Error Theory integration** - Taxonomy scan guided method selection effectively
4. **Adaptive layer activation** - Properly escalated complex artifacts to higher tiers

### V7.1 Innovations That Worked
1. **Error Theory Taxonomy Scan** (Phase 1.4) - Identified error vectors early
2. **Seeded Method Selection** (Phase 3) - Boosted relevant methods based on taxonomy
3. **Hypothesis Generation from Error Theory** (Phase 4.3) - Found hidden issues
4. **Knowledge Injection** (Phase 6.2) - Accessed domain knowledge

## Recommendations

1. **V7.1 is production-ready** for expert-level verification tasks
2. **Error Theory integration is validated** - Keep this enhancement
3. **Consider V7.2** to further optimize token efficiency (current CPF ~19K could target <15K)
4. **Test on even more esoteric domains** (e.g., category theory, topology-based requirements)

---

## Conclusion

Deep Verify V7.1 represents a major breakthrough in AI-assisted verification. The combination of Error Theory taxonomy scanning, seeded method selection, and adaptive layer architecture enables detection of theoretical impossibilities that were previously missed by earlier protocol versions.

**Protocol Status: VALIDATED - Ready for production use**
