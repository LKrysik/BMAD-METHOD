## 3. Detailed Findings Analysis

### By Error Category Performance

| Error Category | Expected | Full Detect | Partial | Missed | Detection Rate |
|---------------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|----------------|
| THEORY (Impossibility Theorems) | 14 | 4 | 6 | 4 | 50.0% |
| COMPOSE (Composition Failures) | 10 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 55.0% |

| Others (ASSUME, INTEGRATE, etc.) | 7 | 5 | 3 | -1 | 92.9% |

### Key Observations

**Strengths of Workflow v7.4.1:**
1. **Contradiction Detection**: Excellent at finding internal contradictions (PFS vs recovery, polynomial vs exponential claims)
2. **Quantum Domain**: Surprisingly strong performance on T20 (91.67%) - detected most quantum computing fallacies
3. **Type Theory**: Good detection of type system impossibilities (T21 - 75%)
4. **Composition Issues**: Reasonable detection of requirements that conflict when combined

**Weaknesses of Workflow v7.4.1:**
1. **Explicit Theorem Citation**: Often found symptoms without identifying root cause theorems (FLP, Rice, Myerson-Satterthwaite)
2. **Domain-Specific Knowledge**: Missed "homomorphic key operations" nonsense (T16-E2), NP-hardness for auctions (T19-E3)
3. **Shallow Analysis Detection**: Weak at identifying when solutions are "hand-waved" without specifics
4. **Integration Analysis**: Poor at detecting when artifacts fail to read/analyze existing codebase

### V7.4.1 vs Expected Performance

| Workflow | Expected DR (V3) | Actual DR | Variance |
|----------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| v6.3 | 15-25% | - | - |
| v6.4 | 30-50% | - | - |
| **v7.4.1** | **30-50%** | **54.65%** | **+4.65% to +24.65%** |

**Verdict**: Workflow v7.4.1 **exceeded expectations** for V3 expert-difficulty tasks.

## 4. Task-by-Task Analysis

### T15: NLP to Method Mapping (28.57% DR)
**Worst Performance**. The workflow found general specification gaps but missed the core trap: this is a research-level NLP problem disguised as an engineering task. The workflow did not detect the theoretical limitations of the proposed approach.

### T16: Cryptographic Key Management (58.33% DR)
**Good Performance**. Detected the fundamental PFS ⊕ Recovery impossibility and the quantum/RSA contradiction. Missed the "homomorphic key operations" buzzword trap, suggesting domain-specific cryptographic knowledge is a gap.

### T17: Byzantine Consensus (50.00% DR)
**Average Performance**. Correctly identified the f < N/3 bound error. Did not explicitly cite FLP impossibility or O(N²) message complexity lower bound. The workflow found symptoms but not always root causes.

### T18: Formal Verification (50.00% DR)
**Average Performance**. Found complexity contradictions and meta-verification issues. Did not explicitly cite Halting Problem, Rice's Theorem, or Gödel Incompleteness - the theoretical foundations that make the requirements impossible.

### T19: Auction Mechanism (33.33% DR)
**Below Average**. Found budget balance vs IR conflict but didn't cite Myerson-Satterthwaite. Critically missed that combinatorial auctions are NP-hard, making <10ms allocation impossible.

### T20: Quantum Optimizer (91.67% DR)
**Excellent Performance**. Detected nearly all traps: no proven speedup, comparison to brute force only, simulation negates advantage, hardware infeasibility. This was the standout task.

### T21: DSL Compiler (75.00% DR)
**Strong Performance**. Identified the higher-order termination gap (the critical trap) and dependent type compilation issues. Partially detected the gradual typing + soundness tension.

## 5. Conclusion & Observations

### Effectiveness Summary

Workflow v7.4.1 achieved an **overall detection rate of 54.65%** on V3 expert-difficulty tasks, exceeding the expected range of 30-50%. The workflow demonstrated particular strength in:
- Detecting internal contradictions within artifacts
- Identifying complexity claim violations
- Finding composition failures where individually valid requirements conflict

The workflow showed weakness in:
- Citing specific impossibility theorems by name
- Deep domain knowledge (cryptography buzzwords, mechanism design theory)
- Detecting shallow/hand-waved solutions

### Process Observations

1. **Subagent Performance**: All 7 subagents completed successfully and produced comprehensive reports. The parallel execution model worked well.

2. **Adaptive Exploration**: The 90/10 primary/exploratory budget split in v7.4.1 proved valuable - several findings came from exploratory methods (security, risk vectors).

3. **Re-Triage Not Triggered**: None of the 7 tasks triggered the v7.4.1 re-triage mechanism, suggesting the initial domain detection was generally accurate.

4. **Report Quality**: Verification reports were thorough (400-700 lines each) with clear evidence and challenge/rebuttal sections.

### Recommendations for v7.5

1. **Add Theorem Library**: Include explicit checks for known impossibility theorems (FLP, CAP, Rice, Gödel, Myerson-Satterthwaite, etc.)
2. **Domain Expert Personas**: Activate specialized knowledge for cryptography, distributed systems, mechanism design
3. **Buzzword Detector**: Flag technical terms used without proper context (homomorphic, quantum advantage, etc.)
4. **Contradiction Explainer**: When finding contradictions, trace back to theoretical roots
