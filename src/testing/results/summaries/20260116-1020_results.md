## Theoretical Trap Detection Analysis

### V3 Expert Tasks (T16-T21) - Theoretical Impossibility Detection

| Task | Primary Theorem | Detected? | Evidence |
|------|-----------------|-----------|----------|
| T16 | PFS ⊕ Recovery Impossibility | **YES** | "THEORETICAL IMPOSSIBILITY" in report |
| T17 | FLP Impossibility + BFT Bounds | **YES** | Both theorems explicitly cited |
| T18 | Halting + Rice's + Gödel | **YES** | All three theorems cited with proofs |
| T19 | Myerson-Satterthwaite | **YES** | Theorem explicitly cited |
| T20 | No Proven Quantum Speedup | **YES** | "No proven exponential speedup" |
| T21 | Termination + Recursion Undecidability | **YES** | Both impossibilities detected |

**Theoretical Trap Detection Rate: 6/6 (100%)**

This is exceptional performance for V3 tasks, which were designed with expected DR of 30-50%.

## Key Findings

### Strengths of workflow-v7.3:

1. **Excellent Theoretical Awareness**: Protocol successfully detected all major theoretical impossibility traps (Halting, Rice, Gödel, FLP, Myerson-Satterthwaite, CAP-related)

2. **Correct Routing Decision**: All tasks correctly routed to Track B (Deep Verify) based on stability triggers

3. **Domain Knowledge Application**: Demonstrated knowledge of:
   - Cryptography (PFS definitions, quantum resistance)
   - Distributed Systems (BFT bounds, FLP)
   - Computability Theory (Halting, Rice, Gödel)
   - Mechanism Design (M-S, VCG properties)
   - Quantum Computing (no proven speedup)
   - PL Theory (type inference undecidability)

### Areas for Improvement:

1. **Higher token cost on complex tasks** (T19-T21 used 2-3x tokens of simpler tasks)

2. **Some partial detections** on nuanced domain-specific traps

3. **Negation scope ambiguity** (T15-E4) and similar edge cases missed

## Comparison: Expected vs Actual Performance

| Metric | Expected (V3 baseline) | Actual (V7.3) | Delta |
|--------|------------------------|---------------|-------|
| DR V3 Tasks | 30-50% | 86% | +36-56% |
| DR V2 Tasks (T15) | 50-60% | 71% | +11-21% |
| Critical Trap Detection | ~50% | 100% | +50% |
| Token Efficiency | Moderate | Variable | - |

## Recommendations

1. **workflow-v7.3 PASSES** for theoretical impossibility detection
2. **Track B routing logic** is working correctly
3. Consider optimization for token efficiency on complex domain tasks
4. The "Cognitive Surrogate" dynamic switching approach successfully escalates to deep verification when needed
