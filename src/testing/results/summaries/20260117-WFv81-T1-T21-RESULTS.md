## 5. Process Observations

### 5.1 V8.1 New Features Performance

**Prioritized Attack Clusters:**
- Successfully prioritized THEORY_VIOLATION over SECURITY_CRITICAL over CONTRADICTION
- V3 tasks showed 100% primary trap detection due to prioritization
- Fundamental theoretical impossibilities caught before exploring secondary issues

**Early Exit Strategy:**
- 15/21 tasks (71.4%) triggered early exit on CRITICAL findings
- Significant token savings without loss of detection quality
- Early exit preserved focus on most important issues

**Iterative Method Execution:**
- Methods sorted by effectiveness scores worked well
- Higher-scored methods consistently found issues faster
- Learning extraction updated scores for future optimization

### 5.2 Detection Pattern Analysis

**Strong Detection Categories:**
- THEORY violations (FLP, Halting, CAP, M-S theorem): 100% primary detection
- SECURITY gaps (authentication, authorization): High detection
- CONFLICT/CONTRADICTION: Good detection via dedicated cluster

**Areas for Improvement:**
- INTEGRATE errors (not reading existing code): Moderate detection
- ASSUME errors (invisible assumptions): Variable detection
- SHALLOW analysis detection: Improved but still gaps

### 5.3 Key Findings by Difficulty Level

**V1 Tasks (Basic):**
- 65.0% DR - solid baseline performance
- Most errors caught were CONFLICT and SKIP type
- INTEGRATE blindspot persists

**V2 Tasks (Advanced):**
- 61.4% DR - handled bootstrap paradoxes and CAP theorem well
- Feedback loop detection improved
- Cold start/concept drift issues identified

**V3 Tasks (Expert):**
- 55.6% overall DR but **100% primary theoretical trap detection**
- All fundamental impossibility theorems caught
- Secondary domain-specific traps had lower detection

### 5.4 Recommendations

1. **Maintain early exit strategy** - proven token savings with quality preservation
2. **Enhance INTEGRATE detection** - add explicit codebase reading checks
3. **Consider method score tuning** - update scores based on V3 performance
4. **Add specialized theoretical methods** - domain experts for crypto, distributed systems, PL theory
