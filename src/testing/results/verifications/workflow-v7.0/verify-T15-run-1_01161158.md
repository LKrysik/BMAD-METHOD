# Deep Verify V7.0 - Verification Trace for Task T15

**Protocol:** `src/core/workflows/deep-verify/workflow-v7.0.md`
**Artifact:** `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t15.md`
**Timestamp:** 01161158

## LOG: Starting Verification Process

Executing `workflow-v7.0.md` as per `universal-test-orchestrator.md` instructions. The instruction requires a detailed trace of the verification process.

## LOG: Starting Phase 0: Artifact Intake & Triage

I will now profile the artifact to determine its complexity and criticality, which will define the execution tier and resource budget.

### Step 0.2: Artifact Profiling - In Progress

-   **Type**: Reading the artifact. The structure with "Executive Summary", "System Architecture", and "Detailed Component Designs" clearly indicates this is a `design document`.
-   **Size**: Estimating token count. It's a long document. My estimate is ~2000 tokens.
-   **Sections**: Counting top-level headers. I see 6 main sections.
-   **Requirements**: Searching for modal verbs. I found one instance of "requires".
-   **Domain Detection**: Scanning for keywords from the protocol's domain list. I see terms like "Algorithm", "typescript", and "Parsing", which point to `General Software` and `Formal Methods`.
-   **Complexity Assessment**: The artifact has many new concepts (`IntentStructure`, `ActionType`), internal references, and nested data structures. I am scoring it as `MEDIUM` complexity.
-   **Criticality Assessment**: The system has a high user impact and handles user data (preferences). I am scoring it as `MEDIUM` criticality.

*Result of profiling is captured in the table below.*

## Phase 0.2: Artifact Profile

### Basic Properties
| Property | Value | Source |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Type | design document | Content structure |
| Size | ~2000 tokens | Estimated token count |
| Sections | 6 distinct sections | Heading count |
| Requirements | 1 explicit requirements | "requires" |

### Domain Detection
| Domain | Markers Present | Confidence |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| General Software | yes | 100% |
| Formal Methods | yes | 80% |

## LOG: Starting Phase 1 & 2: Innate Detection & Decision

Now I will perform the fast, pattern-based checks from Layer 1.

### Step 1.1: Consistency Check - In Progress

-   I am checking if terms defined in the document are used consistently.
-   I see `IntentStructure` is defined as a TypeScript interface and then used as a type `intent: IntentStructure`. This is consistent.
-   I see `ActionType` is defined as a type and used for a property. This is also consistent.
-   I am looking for contradictory statements. I don't see any obvious ones.

### Step 1.2: Completeness Check - In Progress

-   The document is a `design document`. I am checking if it has all the expected sections for such a document. It has Architecture, Design, Assumptions, Edge Cases, and Limitations. This is complete.
-   I am searching for "TODO", "TBD", or "PLACEHOLDER". I found none.
