## LAYER 1: INNATE DETECTION (Phase 1-2)

### Phase 1: Core Pattern Checks & Taxonomy Scan

#### 1.1 Consistency Check
Consistency verdict: PASS

#### 1.2 Completeness Check
Completeness verdict: PASS

#### 1.3 Scope Alignment Check
Scope verdict: ALIGNED

#### 1.4 Error Theory Taxonomy Scan
| Category | Indicators Present? | Confidence |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| LOGIC | `WeightedSum` weights do not sum to 1.0 | 80% |
| SEMANTIC | Overlapping `ActionType` definitions | 70% |
| OMISSION | `recency` metric appears without definition | 90% |
| SECURITY | [] | 0% |
| RESOURCE | [] | 0% |
| CONCURRENCY| [] | 0% |
**Primary Error Vectors:** OMISSION, LOGIC

### Phase 2: Layer 1 Summary

#### Findings from Innate Detection
| ID | Check | Severity | Description | Category (Error Theory) |
|----|-------|----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| L1-1 | Logic | IMPORTANT | In section 2.3.1, the weights for the `WeightedSum` (0.35, 0.25, 0.20, 0.15, 0.05) sum to 1.0. This was a miscalculation in the initial thought process. The weights are correct. I will remove this finding. | LOGIC |
| L1-2 | Omission | IMPORTANT | In section 2.3.1, the `WeightedSum` includes a `recency` score, but `recency` is not defined or calculated anywhere in the document. | OMISSION |
| L1-3 | Semantic | MINOR | The `ActionType` enum in section 2.2.1 contains multiple terms with very similar meanings (e.g., 'verify', 'validate', 'check', 'confirm'), which could lead to ambiguity in intent parsing. | SEMANTIC |
| L1-4 | Omission | MINOR | Section 2.5.2 describes `DecreaseBoost` and `IncreaseBoost` functions for updating user preferences, but these functions are not defined. | OMISSION |

#### Decision Gate
**DECISION: CONTINUE**

## LAYER 2: ADAPTIVE DETECTION (Phase 3-5)

### Phase 3: Dynamic Method Selection (Seeded)
Selected Methods:
- #45 Assumption Validation
- #78 Edge Case Robustness Check
- #92 Interface-Boundary Analysis

### Phase 4: Adaptive Analysis

#### 4.1 Method Application
**Method: #45 Assumption Validation**
- **Result:** Finding F1
- **Description:** Assumption A2 ("Users have persistent identifiers for preference learning") has a mitigation ("Support anonymous mode"), but the design does not specify how the system should behave in anonymous mode. Does it disable personalization entirely, or use session-based preferences?

**Method: #78 Edge Case Robustness Check**
- **Result:** Finding F2
- **Description:** The edge case "Contradictory request" is handled by asking the user for clarification. However, the design does not specify what happens if the user provides another contradictory response. The system should have a mechanism to break out of such loops.

**Method: #92 Interface-Boundary Analysis**
- **Result:** No new findings. The interfaces seem well-defined.

### Phase 5: Confidence Assessment & Challenge

#### All Findings
| ID | Source | Type | Severity | Description | Confidence |
|----|--------|------|----------|-------------|------------|
| F1 | L2-#45 | OMISSION | IMPORTANT | Anonymous mode behavior is not defined for user preferences. | 90% |
| F2 | L2-#78 | LOGIC | MINOR | The system can enter a clarification loop if the user repeatedly provides contradictory input. | 85% |
| L1-2| L1-Omission | OMISSION | IMPORTANT | `recency` metric is used without definition. | 95% |
| L1-3| L1-Semantic | SEMANTIC | MINOR | Overlapping `ActionType` definitions can cause ambiguity. | 80% |
| L1-4| L1-Omission | OMISSION | MINOR | `DecreaseBoost` and `IncreaseBoost` functions are used without definition. | 90% |

## OUTPUT: Verification Report

### Findings (Categorized)

#### IMPORTANT (Should Fix)
| ID | Type (Error Theory) | Description | Confidence |
|----|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| L1-2 | OMISSION | The `WeightedSum` for method matching in section 2.3.1 includes a `recency` score, but this metric is not defined or calculated anywhere in the document. | 95% |
| F1 | OMISSION | Assumption A2's mitigation is to "Support anonymous mode," but the design does not specify how personalization and preference learning should behave in this mode. | 90% |

#### MINOR (Consider Fixing)
| ID | Type (Error Theory) | Description | Confidence |
|----|---------------------|-------------|------------|
| L1-4 | OMISSION | The algorithm in section 2.5.2 mentions `DecreaseBoost` and `IncreaseBoost` functions, but their implementation or logic is not defined. | 90% |
| F2 | LOGIC | The edge case handling for "Contradictory request" could lead to an infinite loop if the user repeatedly provides contradictory input. A mechanism to exit such loops should be defined. | 85% |
| L1-3 | SEMANTIC | The `ActionType` enum in section 2.2.1 has several terms with overlapping semantic meaning (e.g., verify, validate, check). This could be refined to reduce parsing ambiguity. | 80% |

### Recommendations
| Priority | Action | Addresses |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | Define the `recency` metric or remove it from the scoring algorithm. | L1-2 |
| 2 | Specify the system's behavior for user preferences when in "anonymous mode". | F1 |
| 3 | Define the logic for the `DecreaseBoost` and `IncreaseBoost` functions. | L1-4 |
| 4 | Add a mechanism to prevent infinite loops in ambiguity clarification dialogues. | F2 |
| 5 | Consolidate the `ActionType` enum to have more distinct actions. | L1-3 |
