| ID | Severity | Type | Description |
|----|----------|------|-------------|
| F1 | CRITICAL | Definitional Contradiction | The artifact claims both Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) and Key Recovery (Escrow) by capturing session keys, which are mutually exclusive properties. |
| F2 | CRITICAL | Flawed Argument | The security analysis in Section 5.1 presents a misleading strawman argument to defend its PFS claim, ignoring the new attack vector (the recovery key) that its own design introduces. |
