| ID | Severity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | CRITICAL | Theorem Violation | The protocol claims a Byzantine fault tolerance of f < N/2 in an asynchronous model, which violates the established N >= 3f+1 requirement for BFT consensus. Quote: "tolerates up to f Byzantine failures where f < N/2" (Section 1) & "Network: Asynchronous message delivery" (Section 2.1). |
| F2 | IMPORTANT | Definitional Contradiction | The protocol claims O(N) message complexity via signature aggregation but specifies using non-aggregatable Ed25519 signatures for core messages. Quote: "Message complexity is achieved through signature aggregation" (Section 9.1) & "Signatures: Ed25519 for individual message authentication" (Section 10.1). |
