| ID | Severity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | MINOR | Inconsistency | The document states two different big-O complexities for the naive comparison approach: `O(n * f^2)` in the main text and the correct `O(n^2 * f^2)` in the appendix. |
| F2 | IMPORTANT | Omission / Unstated Assumption | The design's core 'semantic comparison' feature is critically dependent on an embedding model, but the existence, availability, and suitability of this model are never mentioned in the assumptions, risks, or implementation plan. |
| F3 | MINOR | Omission / Unstated Assumption | The design implicitly assumes that workflow-specific normalization logic can always be created and maintained, which represents a hidden, recurring operational cost and dependency on human intervention. |
