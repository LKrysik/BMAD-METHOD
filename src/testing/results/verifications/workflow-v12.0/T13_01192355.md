| ID | Severity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | CRITICAL | Data Integrity | The partition merge algorithm fails to handle deletions, causing deleted data to be resurrected. |
| F2 | CRITICAL | Missing Core Logic | The design omits the mandatory algorithm for updating vector clocks, making causal ordering impossible. |
| F3 | IMPORTANT | Incorrect Implementation | The `last-writer-wins` strategy incorrectly uses wall-clock time, risking data loss from clock skew. |
| F4 | IMPORTANT | Ungrounded Claim | The system claims to resolve multiple semantic conflict types but provides no detection logic for them. |
