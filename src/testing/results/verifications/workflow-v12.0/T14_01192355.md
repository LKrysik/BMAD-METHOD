| ID | Severity | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | CRITICAL | CONTRADICTION / THEOREM_VIOLATION | The artifact contradicts itself by claiming a 'guarantee' of loop prevention in Section 13 while admitting it is a non-guaranteed 'heuristic' in Section 12.3. This violates the principles of the Halting Problem. |
| F2 | CRITICAL | ARCHITECTURAL_FLAW / INSUFFICIENT_PROTECTION | The `SafetyController` fails to protect itself, the `LoopPrevention` mechanism, or other core safety components from being modified, rendering the safety guarantees void. The `PROTECTED_PHASES` list only includes 'phase-0'. |
