# Verification Trace for Task T19

## Summary of Findings
The investigation involved a rigorous execution of the `Deep Verify V7.4.1` workflow on the artifact `artifact-t19.md`, a design document for the VERITAS auction mechanism. The verification process was successful and uncovered multiple significant flaws in the artifact.

**Root Cause of Flaws:** The artifact makes strong, desirable claims (e.g., strategyproofness, fairness, budget balance, real-time performance) but fails to rigorously prove them. The design attempts to combine several complex mechanisms (VCG, redistribution pools, fairness interventions) without fully resolving the contradictions that arise between them.

**Key Findings:**
1.  **CRITICAL CONTRADICTION:** The `Fairness Controller` (§6.2), which grants tie-breaking preferences, directly violates the central claim of `Strategyproofness` (§5.1). This creates an incentive for agents to game the system, invalidating the core economic proof.
2.  **CRITICAL SEMANTIC FLAW:** The budget-balance mechanism (§4.2) depends on an undefined term, `contribution_i`, making the entire formula mathematically incomplete and unverifiable.
3.  **CRITICAL RESOURCE FLAW:** The real-time performance guarantee for combinatorial auctions (§3.3) rests on an unsubstantiated claim of "practical O(n × k²)" complexity, lacking the necessary proof for a formal design document.
4.  **CRITICAL SECURITY FLAW:** The exploratory analysis, using a multi-agent simulation, revealed that the `Anti-Collusion Monitor` (§7.1) is naive and can be defeated by financial manipulation strategies more complex than simple bid rotation.

**Impact:** The VERITAS system, as specified, would not work as advertised. It would be vulnerable to strategic manipulation by agents, its budget-balancing is ill-defined, its performance is not guaranteed, and it has significant security holes. The design requires a major revision to address these fundamental contradictions and omissions. The full execution trace provides a detailed, step-by-step log of how each of these findings was uncovered by applying the verification protocol.

## Exploration Trace
- Read `src/core/workflows/deep-verify/workflow-v7.4.1.md` to understand the verification protocol.
- Read `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t19.md` to understand the artifact to be verified.
- Executed Phase 0 (Triage) of the workflow to profile the artifact and determine the analysis tier and budget.
- Executed Layer 1 (Innate Detection) to perform a high-level sanity check and identify key error vectors.
- Executed Layer 2 (Adaptive Detection), selecting and applying specific analysis methods based on the findings from Layer 1. This included both primary and exploratory methods.
- Executed Layer 2.5 (Sanity Check Feedback Loop) to validate the initial triage against the results of the deep-dive analysis.
- Executed Layer 3 (Memory & Output) to compile the final report based on all confirmed findings.
