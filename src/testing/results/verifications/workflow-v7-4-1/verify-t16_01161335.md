# Verification Trace for Task T16

## Summary of Findings
The investigation involved executing the `deep-verify/workflow-v7.4.1.md` protocol against the `artifact-t16.md` design document. The artifact, a cryptographic key management system design, was classified as Tier 4 (High Complexity, High Criticality), triggering a deep analysis. The verification process identified two CRITICAL flaws and several IMPORTANT ones.

**Critical Findings:**
1.  **CRITICAL (Assumption):** The entire security of a session relies on a pre-existing `authenticated_channel` for the initial key exchange (Section 6.1), but the document does not define how this channel is established or what its security requirements are. This outsources the most critical dependency.
2.  **CRITICAL (Contradiction/Leakage):** The pseudocode for key establishment (Section 6.1) implies that the ephemeral `session_key` exists in application memory before being passed to the escrow/recovery function. This contradicts the goal of perfect forward secrecy by creating a potential leakage point that would undermine the separation between the operational and recovery key paths.

**Important Findings:**
*   The specification for 'homomorphic key aggregation' (Section 5.4) is vague and likely unimplementable as described.
*   The security and authentication of 'recovery officers' (Section 4.2) are undefined, creating a high-value attack vector.
*   The design lacks consideration for denial-of-service attacks against the agent network or resource exhaustion.

The `deep-verify` workflow was effective. The initial triage was correct, and the adaptive method selection successfully targeted the riskiest areas of the document, leading to the discovery of significant design flaws. The exploratory budget also correctly identified a blind spot regarding malicious agent incentives.

## Exploration Trace
- Read `src/core/workflows/deep-verify/workflow-v7.4.1.md` to understand the verification protocol.
- Read `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t16.md` to understand the content to be verified.
- Executed the verification protocol step-by-step, logging the output of each phase as a 'Verification Trace'.
- Phase 0 (Triage): Classified the artifact as Tier 4 (High Complexity/High Criticality) due to its nature as a cryptographic design document.
- Layer 1 (Innate Detection): Performed a sanity check which passed, then performed a taxonomy weighting which identified SECURITY, ASSUMPTION, and CONTRADICTION as high-risk vectors.
- Layer 2 (Adaptive Detection): Selected verification methods based on the identified risk vectors (e.g., #101 Cryptographic Review, #78 Assumption Excavation) and an exploratory method (#42 Multi-Agent Incentive Analysis). Executed the methods and identified several critical and important findings.
- Layer 2.5 (Feedback Loop): Confirmed the initial triage was correct as the primary analysis yielded significant findings, so no re-triage was required.
- Layer 3 (Output): Generated a final report summarizing all confirmed findings.
