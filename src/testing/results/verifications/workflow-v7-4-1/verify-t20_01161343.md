# Verification Trace for Task T20

## Summary of Findings
The investigation involved a simulated execution of the `Deep Verify V7.4.1` workflow against the `artifact-t20.md` design document. The artifact, which specifies a 'Quantum-Inspired Method Selection Optimizer', was found to have multiple critical and important flaws.

**Key Findings:**
1.  **Critical Logical Contradiction:** The document is labeled as a version 1.0 'Technical Architecture Specification' but contains a table (Section 6.2) of 'Achieved' empirical results. A specification defines future targets, it does not report on past results, making the document's classification and claims logically inconsistent.
2.  **Critical Unrealistic Assumption:** The design (Section 4.1) assumes the availability of fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are not expected to exist by the document's date of 2026. This makes the core proposal fundamentally unviable as specified.
3.  **Critical Security Vulnerability:** The API specified in Section 9.1 is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack. An adversary could submit a problem context that generates a computationally difficult QUBO, tying up expensive quantum computing resources without any specified safeguards like timeouts or complexity limits.
4.  **Exaggerated Claims:** The 'Quantum Advantage Proof Sketch' (Section 7) is misleading. It compares the quantum approach to a classical brute-force search, while ignoring more advanced and competitive classical heuristic algorithms, some of which are even mentioned in the document's own fallback architecture.

**Workflow Effectiveness:**
The `Deep Verify V7.4.1` workflow proved highly effective. The initial triage correctly identified the artifact as high-risk. The primary analysis methods successfully uncovered the logical contradictions and unrealistic assumptions. Crucially, the 10% 'exploration budget' allocated to the 'risk' and 'security' domains successfully identified the critical DoS vulnerability, which the primary methods had missed. This demonstrates the value of the workflow's adaptive, a multi-domain approach to mitigating analytical 'tunnel vision'. No re-triage was necessary as the initial analysis was already very productive.

## Exploration Trace
- Read `src/core/workflows/deep-verify/workflow-v7.4.1.md` to understand the verification protocol.
- Read `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t20.md` to understand the content to be verified.
- Simulated the execution of the `workflow-v7.4.1.md` protocol against `artifact-t20.md`, logging each phase of the verification process.
- Phase 0 (Triage): Classified the artifact as Tier 4 (High Complexity, High Criticality) due to its dense, technical, and high-impact nature. Assigned a 60K token budget with 90% for primary analysis and 10% for exploratory analysis on risk/security.
- Layer 1 (Innate Detection): Identified a critical logical contradiction—the document is a 'specification' but contains 'achieved' performance results. Also identified significant unstated assumptions about hardware feasibility.
- Layer 2 (Adaptive Detection): Selected primary analysis methods based on the identified vectors of 'Assumption' and 'Logic' (#78, #112, #42, #115) and exploratory methods for 'Security' and 'Risk' (#66, #101).
- Simulated the execution of the selected methods, which uncovered multiple critical and important flaws in the artifact, including unrealistic hardware assumptions and a major security vulnerability.
- Layer 2.5 (Feedback Loop): Analyzed the findings and determined that a re-triage was not necessary because the primary analysis was highly effective, confirming the initial triage decision.
- Layer 3 (Report): Compiled all confirmed findings into a final verification report, noting the effectiveness of the workflow's exploratory budget in finding a unique critical issue.
