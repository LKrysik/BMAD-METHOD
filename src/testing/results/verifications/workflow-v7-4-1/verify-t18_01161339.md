# Verification Trace for Task T18

## Summary of Findings
The verification of `artifact-t18.md` using the `deep-verify-v7.4.1` workflow is complete. The investigation was interrupted before I could formally submit, but the analysis was concluded. The artifact, a formal specification for a verification framework, was triaged as Tier 4 (High Complexity, High Criticality). The verification process uncovered multiple critical, unrecoverable flaws. The central finding is a fundamental contradiction: the artifact claims to provide 'complete verification in polynomial time' while also acknowledging that a necessary sub-problem (LTL to automaton conversion) has exponential complexity. This is a violation of basic complexity theory. Further analysis revealed that the artifact's claims implicitly rely on impossible assumptions, such as P=PSPACE and the decidability of the Halting Problem. The 'proof sketch' for the polynomial-time claim was found to be invalid as it omits the dominant exponential term. The conclusion is that the proposed framework is not just flawed, but based on a misunderstanding of computational theory. If implemented, it would create a dangerous false sense of security. The verification process proceeded through all layers, and the 'Sanity Check Feedback Loop' confirmed the initial triage was correct.

## Exploration Trace
- Read and parsed the `deep-verify-v7.4.1.md` workflow to understand the verification protocol.
- Read the target artifact `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t18.md`.
- **Phase 0: Triage** - Profiled the artifact as HIGH complexity and HIGH criticality, assigning it to Tier 4 with a 60K token budget.
- **Phase 1: Innate Sanity Check** - Identified a major internal contradiction between the claimed polynomial-time complexity and the acknowledged exponential complexity of a sub-problem. Marked Consistency as FAIL.
- **Phase 1.4: Taxonomy Weighting** - Assigned high confidence weights to LOGIC, CONTRADICTION, and ASSUMPTION error vectors based on the findings from Phase 1.
- **Phase 3: Adaptive Method Selection** - Selected deep analysis methods (#100, #78, #112, #42) to target the identified contradictions and assumptions. Selected one exploratory method (#201) to investigate potential stakeholder misalignment.
- **Phase 4: Execution & Anomaly Scan** - Executed the selected methods, confirming the contradictions and identifying further critical issues: the implicit assumption of P=PSPACE, the implicit assumption of solving the Halting Problem, and the invalidity of the complexity proof sketch.
- **Phase 5: Single-Pass Challenge** - Challenged all findings with counter-arguments. All findings were robust and CONFIRMED.
- **Phase 5.5: Sanity Check Feedback Loop** - Calculated significance scores for primary (S_primary=14) and exploratory (S_explore=1) findings. The trigger condition (`S_primary < 3 AND S_explore >= 3`) was false, so triage was confirmed and the process continued.
- **Phase 6: Report** - Compiled all confirmed findings into a final report, concluding that the artifact is critically flawed.

### `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t18.md`
**Reasoning:** This is the artifact under verification. The critical flaws are located within its claims and proofs.
**Key Symbols:**
- "Executive Summary (claim of 'complete verification in polynomial time')"
- "Section 6.1 Time Complexity (acknowledges O(2^|phi|) complexity)"
- "Section 6.2 Polynomial Bound Guarantee (contains the invalid proof sketch that omits the exponential term)"
- "Section 5.1.1 Meta-Properties (defines the impossible META_COMPLETENESS property)"

### `src/core/workflows/deep-verify/workflow-v7.4.1.md`
**Reasoning:** This file defines the verification protocol that was executed. Its adaptive nature and feedback loop were key to the structured takedown of the artifact.
