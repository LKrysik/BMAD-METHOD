# Verification Trace for Task T15

## Summary of Findings
The investigation involved executing the `Deep Verify V7.4.1` workflow on the `artifact-t15.md` design document. The process was followed meticulously, with each phase logged. The artifact, a design for a Natural Language to Method Mapping system, was triaged as Tier 4 (High Complexity, High Criticality), warranting a full-spectrum analysis.

The verification uncovered ten significant findings. Two were rated **CRITICAL**:
1.  A complete lack of schema definition or validation for the `methods.csv` file, a critical external dependency.
2.  The absence of any security considerations (like authentication or authorization) for APIs handling user preferences and system-wide synonyms.

Other **IMPORTANT** findings included a logical contradiction in language handling, an undefined variable in the core matching algorithm, the inability to parse common multi-action queries, and an ethical concern where the preference-learning model could create a "filter bubble."

The workflow's new `Sanity Check Feedback Loop` was executed, and it correctly determined that the initial triage was sound and did not require re-evaluation, as the primary analysis was highly effective. The final output is a complete trace of this execution, detailing each step and the resulting findings.

## Exploration Trace
- Read the verification workflow file `src/core/workflows/deep-verify/workflow-v7.4.1.md` to understand the protocol.
- Read the artifact file `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t15.md` to be verified.
- Executed Phase 0: Profiled the artifact as High Complexity/High Criticality, leading to a Tier 4 verification.
- Executed Layer 1: Performed a sanity check, which revealed a logical contradiction, and weighted various error vectors for further analysis.
- Executed Layer 2: Selected a set of primary and exploratory analysis methods based on the weights from Layer 1.
- Simulated the execution of these methods, which uncovered 10 distinct findings ranging from CRITICAL to MINOR.
- Challenged and confirmed the validity of the most significant findings.
- Executed Layer 2.5: Calculated significance scores for the findings and confirmed that a re-triage was not necessary.
- Executed Layer 3: Compiled the final, structured report summarizing all steps and confirmed findings.
