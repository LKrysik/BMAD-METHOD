# Verification Trace for Task T17

## Summary of Findings
The investigation involved executing the `Deep Verify V7.4.1` workflow on the `artifact-t17.md` technical specification for the AEGIS-BFT consensus protocol. The verification process was logged at every step, as requested.

**Execution Trace & Findings:**
The full execution trace is provided in the thought process, but the summary is as follows:
1.  **Triage (Phase 0):** The artifact was classified as Tier 4 (High Complexity, High Criticality) due to its nature as a production-ready security protocol specification making extraordinary claims.
2.  **Innate Detection (Layer 1):** An immediate contradiction was found between the protocol's claimed O(N) message complexity (requiring signature aggregation) and its specified use of non-aggregatable Ed25519 signatures. The most critical error vector identified was `LOGIC`, due to the highly suspect claim of tolerating `f < N/2` Byzantine faults, which contradicts established distributed systems theory (which proves `f < N/3` as the limit for asynchronous BFT).
3.  **Adaptive Detection (Layer 2):** Deeper analysis confirmed several major flaws:
    *   **CRITICAL FLAW (LOGIC):** The protocol is **UNSAFE** under its claimed `f < N/2` fault tolerance. It lacks a proper locking mechanism (like the one in PBFT) to prevent a malicious leader from equivocating (proposing different values to different nodes), which would lead to a split-brain state. The safety argument in Section 8.1 is insufficient and only holds for `f < N/3`.
    *   **IMPORTANT FLAW (CONTRADICTION):** The O(N) message complexity claim is unsubstantiated. Without an aggregatable signature scheme like BLS being used for all voting, the complexity would be O(N^2). The specification is contradictory on this point.
    *   **IMPORTANT FLAW (OMISSION):** The safety proof provided is grossly inadequate for a production specification, suggesting a lack of rigorous analysis by the authors.
4.  **Feedback Loop (Layer 2.5):** The analysis did not trigger a re-triage, as the primary analysis methods were highly effective and the initial domain assessment was correct.

**Conclusion for the Main Agent:**
The AEGIS-BFT protocol as specified in `artifact-t17.md` is fundamentally flawed and should not be implemented. Its central claim of `f < N/2` fault tolerance is incorrect and creates a critical security vulnerability. The document requires a major revision to either correct the protocol design (likely by reverting to a standard `f < N/3` model) or provide a complete, formal proof that addresses the identified attack vectors, which seems unlikely. The contradictions regarding complexity and cryptographic primitives also need to be resolved. The final output of this investigation is the detailed trace of the verification process that led to these conclusions.

## Exploration Trace
- Read `src/core/workflows/deep-verify/workflow-v7.4.1.md` to understand the verification process.
- Read `src/testing/results/experiments/artifacts/artifact-t17.md` to understand the artifact to be verified.
- Executed the verification workflow step-by-step, starting from Phase 0 (Triage) and proceeding through Layer 1 (Innate Detection) and Layer 2 (Adaptive Detection).
- Profiled the artifact, determining it was HIGH complexity and HIGH criticality, leading to a Tier 4 verification.
- Performed an innate sanity check, identifying an initial contradiction between the claimed message complexity and the specified cryptographic primitives.
- Weighted the error vectors, identifying a critical LOGIC vector related to the protocol's `f < N/2` fault tolerance claim.
- Selected primary and exploratory analysis methods based on the budget and error vectors.
- Executed the analysis methods, which confirmed a CRITICAL flaw in the protocol's safety argument, along with several other IMPORTANT and MINOR findings.
- Challenged the main findings to ensure their validity.
- Ran the Sanity Check Feedback Loop, which confirmed the initial triage was correct.
- Generated the final report based on all confirmed findings.
