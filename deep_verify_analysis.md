# Deep Verify Analysis: V7.0 vs V8.1

## Method #144: Iteration (Comparative Delta Analysis)

**Goal**: Analyze the "delta" between V7.0 (Best) and V8.1 (Correction of a regression) to understand why performance fluctuated and what the current trajectory is.

### Comparison Matrix

| Feature | V7.0 (The Benchmark) | V8.0 (The Failed Simplification) | V8.1 (The Correction) | Delta Impact (V7 vs V8.1) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | 4-Layer "Immune System" (Innate, Adaptive, Memory, Escalation) | Simplified Linear Flow | Hybrid (Phased with Gates) | **Regression**: V8.1 simplifies the 4-layer model into 3 phases. The "Memory" (Learning) layer from V7 is gone in V8.1. |
| **Self-Check** | **Mandatory** Phase 0.1 | Removed | **Restored** Phase 0.1 | **Restored**: V8.1 realized the mistake of removing self-check (0% ASSUME detection in V8.0) and brought it back. |
| **Method Selection** | Dynamic per-artifact (Relevance Scoring) | Fixed/Simplified | Relevance Scoring + Category Mandates | **Parity**: V8.1 keeps the dynamic selection but adds "Category Coverage Check" to prevent blind spots. |
| **Learning/Memory** | **Explicit Learning Loop** (Weight updates) | None | None | **Regression**: V8.1 lacks the "Immune Memory" (Layer 3 of V7) that updates method weights based on success. It's static. |
| **Escalation** | Distinct Layer 4 with Human-in-loop | None | Implicit in "Deferred" output | **Regression**: V7 had a formal escalation protocol. V8.1 downgrades this to a "Deferred" output section. |
| **Anomaly Detection** | Explicit Phase 4.2 with Hypothesis Gen | None | Phase 2.3 (Simplified) | **Simplified**: V8.1 keeps anomaly detection but removes the rigorous "Hypothesis Generation" from First Principles found in V7. |

### Why V7.0 is "Best"
1.  **Learning Loop**: V7.0 is the only version that *improves* over time via `new_weight = old_weight * 0.9 + performance * 0.1`. V8.1 is static.
2.  **Structural Depth**: The 4-layer model in V7 correctly separates "fast checks" (Innate) from "deep thinking" (Adaptive). V8.1 blends them, potentially losing the nuance.
3.  **Hypothesis Generation**: V7.0 Phase 4.3 actively looks for "unknown unknowns" using first principles. V8.1's anomaly detection is more passive ("Scan for unusual patterns").

### The Reality of the Learning Loop (Investigation)
The user asked "Czy 7.0 rzeczywiście jest taki Learning Loop?" (Is the Learning Loop in V7.0 real?).
*   **The File**: `method_scores.yaml` exists and contains weights for methods (e.g., `#127` has `0.93` for `document`).
*   **The Mechanism**: In `workflow-v7.0.md`, Phase 6 explicitly instructs the agent to calculate `new_weight`.
*   **The Gap**: There is no *automated script* that commits these changes. The "Learning Loop" relies on the agent (the LLM) outputting the new weights, and the human user (or a post-processing script) updating the YAML file.
*   **The Benefit**: Even if manual, it forces the system to *measure* ROI. "Method #X cost 5000 tokens and found 0 bugs" -> Weight drops. Next time, it's less likely to be picked. This creates a **Darwinian evolution** of methods, optimizing token efficiency over time.

### Why V8.1 exists
*   V8.0 was an attempt to simplify (likely to reduce token cost or complexity), but it failed catastrophically (0% detection in key areas).
*   V8.1 is a "panic fix" – it restores the obvious missing pieces (Self-Check, Integration) but doesn't fully restore the sophisticated architecture of V7.

## Method #150: Learning Extraction (Successes & Failures)

### What Worked in V7.0 (Successes)
1.  **"Immune System" Metaphor**: Differentiating between "Innate" (always run, cheap) and "Adaptive" (context-dependent, expensive) is highly effective for balancing cost/quality.
2.  **Explicit Uncertainty**: V7 report includes an "Uncertainty Report". This is crucial for trust.
3.  **Triage System**: Allocating budget based on Criticality/Complexity (Tier 1-5) ensures resources aren't wasted on trivial artifacts.

### What Failed in V8.0 (Failures)
1.  **Removing Meta-Cognition**: Removing the "Self-Check" (Method #113, #131) caused "Assumption" detection to drop to 0%. **Lesson**: Meta-cognition is not "overhead"; it's the lens required to see certain errors.
2.  **Over-Simplification**: Linearizing the flow removed the "Escalation" and "Memory" loops, making the process dumb/static.

### The Missing Piece in V8.1
*   **The Learning Layer**: V8.1 identifies itself as "UNVERIFIED" and explicitly says it lacks empirical testing. It dropped the V7 learning mechanism. Without learning, the system cannot adapt to new "virus" strains (new types of errors).

## Conclusion
V7.0 is superior because it is a **dynamic, learning system**. V8.1 is a **static, corrected script**.
To move forward, we should not just "fix" V8.1, but rather **evolve V7.0**. The V8 branch seems to be a "failed branch" of simplification that lost the core value proposition of the Adaptive Verification System.
