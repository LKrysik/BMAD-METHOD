ARTIFACT: Method Effectiveness Tracker - Architecture Design (Run 3)
DATE: 20 stycznia 2026
WORKFLOW VERSION: 12.1

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VERDICT
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

VERDICT: UNCERTAIN
CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM
EVIDENCE SCORE: S = 3.1
EARLY EXIT: No — Full process

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
KEY FINDINGS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[F1] IMPORTANT — The system's core value proposition of finding "optimal" combinations relies on an unaddressed assumption that correlation implies causality.
     Quote: "Causality: Method use causes findings (not correlation only)"
     Location: Section 10. Assumptions
     Pattern: N/A

[F2] MINOR — The mathematical comment describing the synergy score calculation is inconsistent with the corresponding code.
     Quote: "Synergy = P(finding | A and B) / (P(finding | A) + P(finding | B))"
     Location: Section 4.2 Synergy Learning
     Pattern: N/A

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
METHODS EXECUTED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 1:
  □ #71 First Principles — Finding (F1)
  □ #100 Vocabulary Audit — Finding (F2)
  □ #17 Abstraction Laddering — Clean

Phase 2:
  □ #85 Grounding Check — Finding — Selected because: Phase 1 revealed an ungrounded causality assumption. This method confirmed the finding.
  □ #130 Assumption Torture — Finding — Selected because: The core assumption of causality needed to be stress-tested. The test showed catastrophic failure if the assumption is false.
  □ #154 Definitional Contradiction Detector — Finding — Selected because: Phase 1 revealed inconsistent terminology in the synergy formula. This method confirmed the contradiction between the comment and the code logic.

Phase 3:
  □ Adversarial review — 2 findings weakened — The CRITICAL finding on causality was downgraded to IMPORTANT because the system can be viewed as a practical correlation engine despite its claims. The synergy formula finding was downgraded to MINOR as it's likely a documentation error.
  □ Steel-man — 1 argument held — The argument that the artifact is a sound design for a correlation-based recommender that is honest about its assumptions holds up.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOT CHECKED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Infrastructure: The specific implementation details of the `Time-Series Store` were not examined.
- Scalability: Performance under a high load of telemetry data was not analyzed.
- UI/UX: The user-facing aspects of the recommendation service were outside the scope of this architecture document.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If UNCERTAIN:
  1. Question for human reviewer: Is a correlation-based recommender that cannot prove causality acceptable for our purposes, or must this assumption be addressed with mechanisms like A/B testing frameworks?
  2. Question for human reviewer: Should the language in the artifact be toned down from "optimal method combinations" to "statistically correlated methods" to more accurately reflect the system's capabilities?
  3. Recommendation: Correct the synergy score formula in the comment in Section 4.2 to match the implementation: `p_joint / (p_a + p_b - p_a * p_b)`.
