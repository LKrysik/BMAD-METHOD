The investigation was interrupted by a time limit before the core analysis of the 'AdaptLearn' artifact could be performed. The initial phase involved understanding the 'Deep Verify V7.2' methodology by locating and reading its two required dependencies: the domain knowledge base and the methods list. Because the verification process was not executed on the artifact, I am unable to provide the requested verification report or the detailed answers to the 10 meta-analysis questions. The completed steps were necessary prerequisites for the task, but the main analytical work remains unfinished.

Exploration Trace:
- Used `glob` to find the path for `src/core/knowledge/domain-knowledge-base.md`.
- Read the file `src/core/knowledge/domain-knowledge-base.md` to understand the domain knowledge framework for the verification process.
- Used `glob` to find the path for `src/core/methods/methods.csv`.
- Read the file `src/core/methods/methods.csv` to understand the available verification methods.

Relevant Locations:
- FilePath: src/core/knowledge/domain-knowledge-base.md
  Reasoning: This file is a mandatory component of the 'Deep Verify V7.2' workflow. It provides the necessary domain-specific impossibility theorems, term definitions, and checklists required to perform the analysis of the artifact. Understanding its content was the first step in setting up the verification.

- FilePath: src/core/methods/methods.csv
  Reasoning: This file lists all available verification methods for Layer 2 of the 'Deep Verify V7.2' workflow. The process requires selecting methods from this list based on initial findings. Reading this file was a necessary preparatory step.
