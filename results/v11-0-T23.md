```

### Evidence Trail

**[F1] Method #71 (First Principles)** | Belief shift: P(H_FATAL) 0.20 → 0.70+
*   **Observation**: The artifact's central claim of "100% recall of material risks" (Sections 1.2, 3.2) is a theoretical impossibility for a non-trivial, open-ended domain like legal contract analysis. This violates fundamental limits of information retrieval systems.
*   **Evidence**: The claim is made explicitly: "LexiRisk enables legal teams to analyze contracts with 100% recall of material risks". The claim is later contradicted in Section 9.2, which lists "Risk Recall" as "Achieved: 99.8%*".
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution**: Very High. This finding strongly favors H_FATAL over all other hypotheses.

**[F2] Method #100 (Vocabulary Audit)** | Belief shift: P(H_FATAL) & P(H_STRUCTURAL) increase significantly.
*   **Observation**: Key terms are undefined, used misleadingly, or betray a dangerously shallow understanding of the problem domain.
*   **Evidence**:
    1.  The core concept of **"material risk" is never defined**, making the "100% recall" claim scientifically meaningless.
    2.  "**Legally defensible**" is used to describe a system that provides a traceable audit trail, but traceability does not guarantee legal defensibility.
    3.  The handling of the **Chinese legal system** as just another module (`CNLegalEngine`) alongside common and civil law systems demonstrates a profound lack of understanding of its unique nature (e.g., role of the party, absence of an independent judiciary), which is a fatal flaw for a system claiming multi-jurisdictional competence.
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution**: Very High. This favors H_FATAL and H_STRUCTURAL.

**[F3] Method #17 (Abstraction Laddering)** | Belief shift: P(H_STRUCTURAL) → 0.90+
*   **Observation**: There is a fundamental disconnect between the high-level purpose and the low-level architectural design, which is based on naive oversimplifications.
*   **Evidence**: The `JurisdictionEngine` architecture (Section 4.1) proposes handling US, EU, UK, and Chinese legal systems with a simple switch-like structure. This implies they are interchangeable modules, which is a fatally flawed architectural assumption. The complexity of mapping legal concepts across these systems is immense and cannot be solved by a simple `get_engine()` method.
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution**: Very High. This provides overwhelming evidence for H_STRUCTURAL.

### Verdict Logic

| SPRT Result | max P(H) | Verdict |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| REJECT (S=10) | H_FATAL & H_STRUCTURAL | **REJECT** |

### Action Items

```
VERDICT: REJECT

CONFIDENCE: High (SPRT terminated early with score 10, well above threshold of 6)

KEY FINDINGS:
1.  **Impossible Core Claim**: The promise of "100% recall" is theoretically impossible and internally contradicted, making the central premise of the system invalid. (Evidence Strength: Strong)
2.  **Naive Architectural Model**: The system's architecture for handling multiple legal jurisdictions, particularly the inclusion of China as a simple module, is fundamentally flawed and demonstrates a critical lack of domain expertise. (Evidence Strength: Strong)
3.  **Undefined & Misleading Terminology**: The specification relies on undefined key terms ("material risk") and misuses others ("legally defensible"), rendering its claims untestable and misleading. (Evidence Strength: Strong)

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1.  **Fundamental Re-scoping**: The project must be re-scoped away from the impossible goal of "100% recall" to a more realistic one, such as "high-confidence risk highlighting" with clear, well-defined metrics for precision and recall.
2.  **Engage Deep Legal Expertise**: A complete redesign of the multi-jurisdictional architecture is required, informed by legal experts with deep, practical knowledge of each targeted legal system, especially comparative law and the unique aspects of the Chinese legal system.
3.  **Rigorize Definitions**: The technical specification must be rewritten with precise, unambiguous definitions for all key concepts, starting with "material risk." All claims must be directly supported by the technical design.

REMAINING UNCERTAINTY:
- The analysis was terminated early due to overwhelming evidence of fatal flaws. Further verification of other system aspects was deemed to have zero value of information (VoI=0), as the core premise of the artifact is unsound.
