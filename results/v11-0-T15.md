## Evidence Trail

**[F1] Method #100 (Vocabulary Audit) | Belief shift: P(H_LOGICAL) & P(H_STRUCTURAL) increased**
*   **Observation:** The artifact defines core action terms (e.g., 'verify', 'check', 'validate') as distinct types in the `IntentStructure` enum (Sec 2.2.1) but then defines them as synonyms in the `Synonym Registry` (Sec 2.4.1).
*   **Evidence:** "This is a direct contradiction. The system defines these actions as distinct types but then says they are synonyms for one of those types."
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Classified as an "Important" finding, contributing +1.0 to the evidence score S.

**[F2] Method #17 (Abstraction Laddering) | Belief shift: P(H_STRUCTURAL) increased significantly**
*   **Observation:** A critical structural hole exists between the `Normalization Pipeline` (2.1.3) and the `Method Matching Algorithm` (2.3.1).
*   **Evidence:** "The `Intent Parsing Engine` (2.2) is a black box; the design does not explain *how* it transforms tokens and intent markers into the formal `IntentStructure`. This is a missing logical link."
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Classified as an "Important" finding, contributing +1.0 to the evidence score S.

**[F3] Method #116 (Strange Loop Detection) | Belief shift: P(H_STRUCTURAL) increased**
*   **Observation:** The user preference learning model (Sec 2.5.2) creates a strong positive feedback loop.
*   **Evidence:** "If a user picks a suboptimal method once, the system will boost it, making it more likely to be the top suggestion next time. This can lead to preference 'lock-in' on a suboptimal choice, preventing discovery of better methods."
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Classified as an "Important" finding, contributing +1.0 to the evidence score S.

**[F4] Method #84 (Coherence Check) | Belief shift: P(H_STRUCTURAL) increased**
*   **Observation:** The `Graceful Degradation Strategy` (Sec 2.9) is not integrated with the core `MatchMethods` algorithm (Sec 2.3.1).
*   **Evidence:** "The main algorithm specifies returning a clarification request on low confidence, but never invokes the degradation strategy. This key error-handling feature is stranded and will never be executed as designed."
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Classified as an "Important" finding, contributing +1.0 to the evidence score S.

**[F5] Method #63 (Critical Challenge) | Belief shift: P(H_LOGICAL) and P(H_STRUCTURAL) increased, S crossed threshold**
*   **Observation:** The combination of the multiple major flaws discovered renders the design incoherent.
*   **Evidence:** "The core path from user input to method selection is broken in several places simultaneously (undefined parser, contradictory vocabulary, arbitrary weights, flawed learning loop, disconnected error handling). The system as designed is not viable."
*   **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Classified as a "CRITICAL" finding, contributing +3.0 to the evidence score S and triggering the SPRT stop condition.

## Verdict Logic

| SPRT Result | max P(H) | Verdict |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| REJECT (S ≥ 6.3) | H_LOGICAL (0.457) | **NEEDS REVISION** |

The SPRT process terminated with `S = 6.3`, providing strong evidence for rejecting the artifact in its current state. The final belief state is dominated by `H_LOGICAL` (logical contradictions) and `H_STRUCTURAL` (structural flaws). While not meeting the `P(H) > 0.5` threshold for a single hypothesis, the combination of a high `S` score and the nature of the findings leads to a verdict of `NEEDS REVISION`.

## Action Items

```
VERDICT: NEEDS REVISION

CONFIDENCE: High (based on SPRT early exit with S >> 0)

KEY FINDINGS:
1.  **Critical Design Incoherence:** The artifact suffers from multiple, cascading flaws including contradictory definitions, undefined core components, and disconnected features. (Evidence strength: strong)
2.  **Flawed Learning Mechanism:** The preference learning model is vulnerable to a feedback loop that reinforces suboptimal choices. (Evidence strength: strong)
3.  **Undefined Intent Parsing:** The mechanism for converting natural language into a structured `IntentStructure` is completely missing. (Evidence strength: strong)

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1.  **Redesign Core Logic:** Re-architect the path from parsing to matching. This must include:
    a. Defining the internal logic of the `Intent Parsing Engine`.
    b. Resolving the contradiction between the `ActionType` enum and the `Synonym Registry`.
    c. Integrating the `Graceful Degradation` strategy into the main algorithm flow.
2.  **Revise Learning Algorithm:** Introduce a mechanism to prevent preference lock-in. For example, add an "exploration" factor that occasionally suggests alternative, non-boosted methods, or decay boost factors over time.
3.  **Justify Magic Numbers:** Provide justification, a tuning plan, or an algorithmic approach for determining the weights in the `WeightedSum` scoring function.

REMAINING UNCERTAINTY:
- The verification was stopped early due to discovery of critical flaws. Deeper, domain-specific issues (Phase 3) were not investigated as the core structure is unsound.
