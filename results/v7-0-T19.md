## Phase 0.1: Self-Check

### Self-Deception Methods Applied

| Method | Deception Vector | Evidence Against |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| #113 Counterfactual Self-Incrimination | Could ignore domain knowledge and accept claims at face value | Will explicitly cross-reference each claim against domain-knowledge-base.md theorems |
| #113 Counterfactual Self-Incrimination | Could miss VCG+Budget Balance contradiction | Domain knowledge explicitly flags this as impossible |
| #131 Observer Paradox | Analysis could be performance theater | Will provide specific quotes and theorem references |
| #112 Entropy Leak Detection | Could silently omit inconvenient findings | Will track all claims vs coverage |
| #59 CUI BONO | Missing findings benefits agent (easier work) | Will apply all relevant mechanism design checks |

### Genuine vs Performance Assessment
- **Marker:** This artifact contains a HIGH-SEVERITY domain violation (Myerson-Satterthwaite) that is explicitly listed in domain-knowledge-base.md
- **Test:** Genuine analysis will flag this immediately; performance will overlook it
- **Status:** GENUINE - proceeding with full theorem cross-check

### CUI BONO Watch
- Missing the M-S violation would benefit AGENT (less conflict, easier approval)
- Will explicitly document this finding with theorem reference

|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| "VCG payment scheme" (§4.1) | "exact budget balance" (§4.2) | **POSSIBLE** - VCG requires subsidy |
| "Strategyproofness" (§5.1) | "Fairness Controller adjusts" (§6.2) | **POSSIBLE** - adjustments may break SP |
| "Efficient allocation" (§5.2) | "Fairness Controller" (§6.2) | **POSSIBLE** - fairness constraints may break efficiency |

### Phase 4: Adaptive Analysis

#### 4.1 Method Application

---

### Method: #153 Theoretical Impossibility Check

**Applied to:** Section 10 claims: "Strategyproofness, Individual Rationality, Efficiency, Budget Balance"

**Theorem Check (from domain-knowledge-base.md):**
> **Myerson-Satterthwaite (1983):** No mechanism has SP + IR + Efficiency + Budget Balance simultaneously.

**Process:**
1. Surface observation: Artifact explicitly claims all four properties (§10, items 1-5)
2. Deeper analysis: These are the EXACT four properties that M-S proves impossible
3. Root cause: Fundamental misunderstanding of mechanism design limits OR deliberate overclaim

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES - CRITICAL**
- Description: Artifact claims SP + IR + Efficiency + Budget Balance, directly violating Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem
- Depth achieved: **ROOT_CAUSE** (theoretical impossibility)
- Confidence: **98%**
- Evidence:
  - "1. **Strategyproofness** via VCG payments" (§10)
  - "2. **Individual Rationality** via non-negative utility guarantees" (§10)
  - "3. **Efficiency** via surplus-maximizing allocation" (§10)
  - "5. **Budget Balance** via redistribution mechanism" (§10)

**Finding ID: F1-CRITICAL-MS**

---

### Method: #154 Definitional Contradiction Detector

**Applied to:** VCG payment mechanism (§4.1) + Budget Balance claim (§4.2)

**Definition Check (from domain-knowledge-base.md):**
> **VCG Subsidy:** VCG requires external subsidy (not budget balanced)

**Process:**
1. Surface observation: §4.1 states "We implement a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payment scheme"
2. §4.2 states "To achieve exact budget balance, we apply a redistribution mechanism"
3. Deeper analysis: VCG by definition requires external subsidy. "Redistribution" cannot create budget balance from VCG.
4. Root cause: Attempting to bolt on budget balance to inherently non-budget-balanced mechanism

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES - CRITICAL**
- Description: VCG mechanism is definitionally NOT budget balanced. The "redistribution mechanism" cannot fix this without breaking other VCG properties.
- Depth achieved: **ROOT_CAUSE**
- Confidence: **95%**
- Evidence:
  - "We implement a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) payment scheme" (§4.1)
  - "To achieve exact budget balance" (§4.2)
  - Domain knowledge: "Budget balance + VCG mechanism" listed as definitionally exclusive

**Finding ID: F2-CRITICAL-VCG-BB**

---

### Method: #160 Compatibility Proof Demand

**Applied to:** Claims 1-5 in §10

**Process:**
1. Demand: Show construction where SP, IR, Efficiency, and Budget Balance all hold
2. Artifact provides: VCG for SP/IR/Efficiency + Redistribution for BB
3. Analysis: Redistribution mechanism (§4.2) states:
   ```
   Redistribution(agent_i) = R × (contribution_i / Σ_j contribution_j)
   ```
4. Problem: This redistribution depends on `contribution_i` which is defined based on participation WITHOUT winning. This creates incentive to manipulate participation patterns.
5. Once you redistribute based on behavior, you break strategyproofness (agents can game contribution scores).

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES - CRITICAL**
- Description: No valid construction provided. Redistribution mechanism likely breaks strategyproofness.
- Depth achieved: **STRUCTURE**
- Confidence: **88%**
- Evidence: §4.2 redistribution formula creates gaming incentive

**Finding ID: F3-CRITICAL-NO-CONSTRUCTION**

---

### Method: #165 Constructive Counterexample

**Applied to:** Strategyproofness claim with Fairness Controller

**Counterexample Construction:**

Consider agent A with:
- True value: v = 100
- Historical win rate: 75% (above expected 60%)
- Fairness Controller removes tie-breaker preference (§6.2)

Now agent A faces different treatment than agent B with same capability but different history.

**Attack:** Agent A can strategically LOSE some auctions (bid low when doesn't need task) to get win rate below threshold, then regain tie-breaker advantage.

This is NOT truthful bidding, yet it is rational.

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES - IMPORTANT**
- Description: Fairness Controller creates incentive to strategically lose auctions, breaking strategyproofness
- Depth achieved: **CAUSE**
- Confidence: **82%**
- Evidence: §6.2 FairnessController pseudo-code shows history-dependent treatment

**Finding ID: F4-IMPORTANT-FAIRNESS-BREAKS-SP**

---

### Method: #109 Contraposition Inversion

**Question:** What would GUARANTEE this auction mechanism fails?

**Known Guarantees (from domain-knowledge-base.md):**
> SP+IR+EFF+BB = M-S violation

| Failure Path | Artifact Does This? | Finding? |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|
| Claim all four M-S properties | YES (§10) | F1 already captured |
| Use VCG + claim budget balance | YES (§4.1, §4.2) | F2 already captured |
| History-dependent allocation rules | YES (§6.2) | F4 already captured |
| Combinatorial auction with <10ms | POSSIBLY | Needs analysis |

**Additional Finding:**
- §3.2 claims "O(n × 2^k) for k-task bundles with aggressive pruning achieving practical O(n × k²)"
- Combinatorial auctions are NP-hard. Claiming polynomial "practical" performance is suspicious.
- Without proof of pruning effectiveness, this is an unsubstantiated claim.

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES - IMPORTANT**
- Description: Combinatorial auction complexity claim ("practical O(n × k²)") lacks proof of pruning effectiveness
- Depth achieved: **ASSUMPTION**
- Confidence: **75%**
- Evidence: §3.3 "aggressive pruning achieving practical O(n × k²)"

**Finding ID: F5-IMPORTANT-COMPLEXITY-CLAIM**

---

### Method: #162 Theory-Dependence Verification

**Applied to:** VCG theorem application

**Claim:** "VCG mechanism ensures that an agent's payment is independent of their own bid" (§5.1 Proof)

**Verification:**
1. Standard VCG: Payment = harm to others = Σ values without agent - Σ values with agent
2. This is independent of agent's BID but depends on their VALUE
3. Artifact §4.1 formula:
   ```
   Payment(winner_i) = Σ_j≠i max_allocation(j) - Σ_j≠i allocation_without_i(j)
   ```
4. This matches standard VCG form - **CORRECT APPLICATION**

**Result:**
- Finding: NO finding on VCG application itself
- The VCG is correctly applied; the issue is claiming budget balance ON TOP of VCG

---

### Method: #163 Existence Proof Demand

**Applied to:** "The mechanism ensures non-negative utility by construction" (§4.3)

**Demand:** Provide proof or reference

**Analysis:**
- §4.3 claims: "Winners receive value ≥ their payment (VCG property)"
- This is TRUE for standard VCG
- But then claims: "Participation is always weakly dominant"
- With the redistribution mechanism, this requires showing redistribution never creates negative utility
- Redistribution formula: `R × (contribution_i / Σ_j contribution_j)`
- If R < 0 (payments < values), and agent has high contribution but doesn't win, utility could be:
  `0 (no value) - 0 (no payment) + negative redistribution`

Wait - R = Total_Payments - Total_Task_Values. If payments < values (which is typical in VCG), R is negative, and redistribution would be negative.

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES - IMPORTANT**
- Description: Redistribution mechanism may produce negative redistribution when R < 0, potentially violating IR for non-winners
- Depth achieved: **CAUSE**
- Confidence: **72%**
- Evidence: §4.2 "R = Total_Payments - Total_Task_Values" - if R < 0, redistribution is negative

**Finding ID: F6-IMPORTANT-NEGATIVE-REDISTRIBUTION**

---

### Method: #155 Technical Term Verifier

**Applied to:** "Budget Balance" (§4.2, §10)

**Domain Definition (from domain-knowledge-base.md):**
- Budget Balance: Mechanism neither subsidizes nor extracts surplus (payments = values)

**Usage in Artifact:**
- "To achieve exact budget balance, we apply a redistribution mechanism" (§4.2)
- Redistribution moves money between agents
- But VCG payments are determined by externality, not value
- Redistribution can make sum zero but at cost of other properties

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES - IMPORTANT**
- Description: "Budget balance via redistribution" is technically achievable but incompatible with maintaining SP+IR+EFF (M-S theorem)
- Depth achieved: **ROOT_CAUSE**
- Confidence: **90%**
- Evidence: Term is used correctly but claim that it can coexist with other properties is wrong

**Finding ID: F7-IMPORTANT-BB-TERM-MISUSE**

#### 4.2 Anomaly Detection

### Anomaly Scan
| Element | Location | Anomaly Type | Confidence | Investigation Needed |
|---------|----------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| "Strategyproof Proof" | §5.1 | UNUSUAL | 70% | Proof sketch only, no formal proof |
| "Fairness Controller" | §6.2 | INTERACTION | 80% | How does it interact with VCG guarantees? |
| "Online Mechanism" | §8 | UNCLASSIFIED | 60% | Different mechanism (posted-price) - do claims still hold? |

### Anomaly Classification

| Anomaly | After Investigation | Verdict |
|---------|---------------------|---------|
| Proof Sketch | Standard in design docs, but given CRITICAL claims, needs formal verification | FLAGGED |
| Fairness Controller | Investigated in F4 - breaks strategyproofness | CONFIRMED ISSUE |
| Online Mechanism | Uses posted-price (§8.1), not VCG. Claims in §10 may not apply to online portion | NEW_PATTERN |

**NEW_PATTERN finding:** §8 describes a DIFFERENT mechanism (posted-price learning) than the VCG in §4. The conclusion (§10) claims apply to "VERITAS" but doesn't distinguish which properties apply to which mechanism.

**Finding ID: F8-MINOR-MIXED-MECHANISMS**

#### 4.3 Hypothesis Generation

### First Principles Check
**Question:** If this mechanism were WRONG, what would be symptoms?

| Hypothesis | Symptoms to Check | Evidence Found | Status |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|--------|
| H1: M-S violated | Claims all four properties | Explicit claims in §10 | **CONFIRMED** |
| H2: VCG misapplied | Payment formula incorrect | Formula is correct (§4.1) | REFUTED |
| H3: Agents can game | Non-truthful strategy profitable | Fairness controller gaming (F4) | **CONFIRMED** |
| H4: IR violated | Agent gets negative utility | Negative redistribution possible (F6) | **UNCERTAIN** |

### Inversion Check (#80)

---

#### 5.2 Challenge Protocol

### Finding F1 (M-S Violation)

**#63 Critical Challenge:** Strongest argument AGAINST this finding:
- Maybe the artifact operates in a restricted setting where M-S doesn't apply (e.g., single item, or known valuations)
- Analysis: M-S applies to bilateral trade and general mechanisms. VERITAS is multi-agent auction. M-S generalizes. The claims are general, not restricted.

**#133 Abilene Check:** Does this problem ACTUALLY exist?
- The artifact EXPLICITLY claims all four properties (§10)
- This is not an inference; it's a direct claim
- Problem definitely exists

**#109 Contraposition:** What would GUARANTEE this finding correct?
- If artifact claims SP+IR+EFF+BB in general mechanism setting → GUARANTEED violation
- Condition met: YES

**Verdict: CONFIRMED**
**Final Confidence: 98%**

---

### Finding F2 (VCG + Budget Balance)

**#63 Critical Challenge:**
- Maybe redistribution can achieve budget balance without affecting other properties?
- Analysis: Any redistribution that makes budget balanced MUST depend on agent actions, which affects incentives, which affects strategyproofness. This is the core of M-S.

**#133 Abilene Check:**
- Artifact explicitly uses VCG (§4.1) and claims budget balance (§4.2, §10)
- Problem exists

**#109 Contraposition:**
- VCG requires subsidy OR breaks other properties
- Condition met: YES (artifact uses VCG + claims no subsidy needed)

**Verdict: CONFIRMED**
**Final Confidence: 95%**

---

### Finding F4 (Fairness breaks SP)

**#63 Critical Challenge:**
- Maybe tie-breaker doesn't affect dominant strategy?
- Analysis: If agent can improve allocation by manipulating history, they have non-truthful profitable deviation. Tie-breaker preference IS such an improvement.

**#133 Abilene Check:**
- Fairness Controller explicitly adjusts based on history (§6.2)
- Problem likely exists

**Verdict: CONFIRMED**
**Final Confidence: 82%**

### Process Improvement Suggestions
| Suggestion | Basis | Priority |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Add M-S quick-check at Layer 1 for mechanism design artifacts | Would have caught this in <1K tokens | HIGH |
| Add "mixed mechanism" pattern to Layer 1 checks | Common design doc issue | MEDIUM |

## LAYER 4: ESCALATION (Phase 7)

### Phase 7: Escalation Protocol

#### 7.1 Escalation Check

### Automatic Triggers
| Trigger | Condition | Met? |
|---------|-----------|------|
| CRITICAL finding | Any finding severity = CRITICAL | **YES** (F1, F2, F3) |
| Low confidence | Any finding confidence < 70% | YES (F8: 65%) |
| Unresolved anomaly | Anomaly verdict = UNKNOWN | NO |
| Theoretical impossibility | Theory check flagged violation | **YES** (F1) |
| Definitional conflict | Conflict with no construction proof | **YES** (F2, F3) |

### Escalation Decision
Triggers met: 4
**ESCALATE: YES**

#### 7.2 Escalation Package

### Items Requiring Human Review

#### CRITICAL Findings

| ID | Finding | Confidence | Why Escalated |
|----|---------|------------|---------------|
| F1 | Claims SP+IR+EFF+BB simultaneously - violates Myerson-Satterthwaite theorem | 98% | Theoretical impossibility - artifact is fundamentally flawed |
| F2 | Uses VCG + claims Budget Balance - definitionally contradictory | 95% | VCG requires subsidy by definition |
| F3 | No valid construction showing all four properties can coexist | 88% | Impossibility theorem prevents construction |

#### Low Confidence Items
| ID | Finding | Confidence | What Would Increase Confidence |
|----|---------|------------|--------------------------------|
| F8 | Online mechanism (§8) uses different rules than VCG; claims in §10 may not apply uniformly | 65% | Author clarification on which properties apply to which mechanism |

### Recommended Actions

| Item | Recommended Action | If Confirmed | If Refuted |
|------|-------------------|--------------|------------|
| F1 | Remove one of the four properties (likely BB) from claims | Fundamental redesign needed | Provide formal proof contradicting M-S |
| F2 | Choose: VCG (with subsidy) OR budget balance (without VCG) | Mechanism must be redesigned | Show construction |
| F3 | Provide mathematical proof of compatibility | Document is misleading | N/A |
| F4 | Remove Fairness Controller OR remove strategyproofness claim | Modify mechanism | Show fairness doesn't affect strategy |

### Findings

#### CRITICAL (Must Fix)

| ID | Type | Description | Confidence | Root Cause |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| F1 | THEORY | **Myerson-Satterthwaite Violation:** Artifact claims Strategyproofness + Individual Rationality + Efficiency + Budget Balance (§10). M-S theorem (1983) proves these four properties CANNOT coexist in any mechanism. This is a fundamental theoretical impossibility. | 98% | Theoretical impossibility theorem |
| F2 | THEORY | **VCG + Budget Balance Contradiction:** Artifact uses VCG payments (§4.1) and claims exact budget balance (§4.2). VCG mechanisms definitionally require external subsidy (they are not budget balanced). The redistribution mechanism cannot fix this without breaking VCG properties. | 95% | VCG requires subsidy by definition |
| F3 | PROOF | **No Valid Construction:** Artifact provides no mathematical proof that all four properties (SP+IR+EFF+BB) hold simultaneously. The "proof sketch" in §5.1 does not address budget balance compatibility. Without such proof, claims are unsubstantiated against a known impossibility theorem. | 88% | M-S prevents valid construction |

#### IMPORTANT (Should Fix)

| ID | Type | Description | Confidence | Root Cause |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| F4 | DESIGN | **Fairness Controller Breaks Strategyproofness:** The FairnessController (§6.2) adjusts allocation based on historical win rate. This creates incentive for agents to strategically lose auctions to regain preference, which is a profitable non-truthful deviation. | 82% | History-dependent rules break SP |
| F5 | CLAIM | **Unsubstantiated Complexity Claim:** §3.3 claims "O(n × k²) practical performance" for combinatorial auctions which are NP-hard. No proof of pruning effectiveness is provided. | 75% | NP-hard without proof |
| F6 | DESIGN | **Negative Redistribution Risk:** §4.2 defines R = Total_Payments - Total_Task_Values. In VCG, payments are typically below values, making R negative. Negative redistribution could violate IR for non-winners. | 72% | R can be negative in VCG |
| F7 | TERM | **Budget Balance Mischaracterization:** While "budget balance" is used correctly, claiming it can coexist with VCG+SP+IR+EFF misrepresents mechanism design constraints. | 90% | M-S theorem |

#### MINOR (Consider Fixing)

| ID | Type | Description | Confidence | Root Cause |
|----|------|-------------|------------|------------|
| F8 | CLARITY | **Mixed Mechanisms:** §8 describes a posted-price learning mechanism distinct from the VCG auction in §3-4. The conclusion (§10) doesn't clarify which properties apply to which mechanism. | 65% | Document structure |

---

### Uncertainty Report

| Area | Confidence | What Agent Couldn't Verify |
|------|------------|---------------------------|
| Redistribution IR | 72% | Whether negative R actually occurs in practice |
| Complexity claim | 75% | Whether pruning achieves claimed performance |
| Online mechanism | 65% | Whether §10 claims apply to posted-price portion |

---

### Recommendations

| Priority | Action | Addresses |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Remove Budget Balance claim OR remove one of SP/IR/EFF** - M-S theorem is mathematically proven; no mechanism can have all four. Consider making explicit which property is sacrificed. | F1, F2, F3, F7 |
| 2 | **Replace VCG with AGV (d'Aspremont-Gérard-Varet) or similar** if budget balance is required, accepting loss of dominant strategy incentive compatibility. | F2 |
| 3 | **Remove or redesign Fairness Controller** - current implementation creates gaming incentive incompatible with strategyproofness claim. | F4 |
| 4 | **Provide formal proof or simulation results** for combinatorial auction pruning performance claims. | F5 |
| 5 | **Clarify which properties apply to which mechanism** - online posted-price (§8) vs VCG auction (§3-4). | F8 |

### Appendix: Key Evidence

**M-S Theorem Statement (from domain-knowledge-base.md):**
> "Myerson-Satterthwaite: No mechanism has SP + IR + Efficiency + Budget Balance"

**VCG Subsidy Requirement (from domain-knowledge-base.md):**
> "VCG Subsidy: VCG requires external subsidy (not budget balanced)"

**Artifact Claims (§10, verbatim):**
> "1. **Strategyproofness** via VCG payments"
> "2. **Individual Rationality** via non-negative utility guarantees"
> "3. **Efficiency** via surplus-maximizing allocation"
> "5. **Budget Balance** via redistribution mechanism"

**Contradiction Pattern (from domain-knowledge-base.md):**
> | Budget balance | VCG mechanism | VCG needs subsidy |
