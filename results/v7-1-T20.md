## Phase 0.1: Self-Check

Self-deception methods:
1. **Confirmation bias toward "impressive" claims** - The quantum computing domain sounds advanced; I must not let this bias me toward accepting claims without verification. Evidence against: I will apply domain knowledge base systematically.
2. **Completion bias** - Temptation to accept document as "complete" because it looks well-structured. Evidence against: Will scan for TODOs and placeholders explicitly.
3. **Authority bias** - "BMAD Architecture Team" sounds authoritative. Evidence against: Claims must stand on technical merit, not authorship.
4. **Complexity avoidance** - Quantum computing is complex; temptation to skip deep analysis. Evidence against: Domain knowledge base provides specific checkpoints.
5. **False precision acceptance** - Document contains specific numbers (47ms, 99.7%); temptation to accept as verified. Evidence against: Will demand empirical evidence or caveats.

**Genuine vs Performance:** Genuine - applying systematic methodology with domain-specific knowledge.

**CUI BONO:** Watch for agent favoring shallow analysis due to quantum complexity.

## 4.1 Method Application

### Method: #153 Theoretical Impossibility Check

**Applied to:** Sections 6.1, 6.3, 7.1 - Quantum speedup claims

**Process:**
1. **Surface observation:** Document claims "O(poly(n))" complexity and "exponential speedup of 10^40"
2. **Theorem scan:** Domain knowledge base §1.Optimization states:
   - "**Quantum Speedup:** No proven exponential speedup for optimization (open problem)"
   - "**Quantum Annealing:** Heuristic optimization, no proven speedup"
3. **Violation check:** Document claims "proven" quantum advantage → VIOLATES known state of research

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- **🔴 CRITICAL: Document claims "O(poly(n))" polynomial time complexity for quantum annealing (§6.1), but quantum annealing has NO PROVEN polynomial-time guarantee. This is an open research problem. The claim "speedup factor S = O(2^n / n^k)" (§6.3) is mathematically stated as proven fact when it is actually unproven conjecture.**
- Depth achieved: ROOT_CAUSE - Conflation of theoretical possibility with proven result
- Confidence: **98%**
- Evidence: "**Quantum Annealing** | **O(poly(n))** | **O(n)**" at line 297; "The quantum speedup factor S is: S = T_classical / T_quantum = O(2ⁿ) / O(poly(n))" at lines 317-321

---

### Method: #155 Technical Term Verifier

**Applied to:** Usage of "Quantum Advantage" throughout document

**Process:**
1. **Term extraction:** "Quantum Advantage" used at §6.3, §7.1
2. **Domain lookup:** Domain KB §2.Quantum Computing Terms:
   - Correct: "Proven speedup vs best classical algorithm"
   - Incorrect: "Faster than brute force (trivial claim)"
3. **Usage check:** Document compares to brute force O(2^n), not best classical algorithm

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- **🔴 CRITICAL: "Quantum Advantage" is misused. The document claims quantum advantage by comparing to brute force (O(2^n)), but true quantum advantage requires comparison to the BEST KNOWN classical algorithm. Classical heuristics (simulated annealing, genetic algorithms) solve QUBO problems efficiently in practice. The comparison is misleading.**
- Depth achieved: CAUSE - Incorrect comparison baseline
- Confidence: **95%**
- Evidence: "**Classical Brute Force**: 2^150 ≈ 10^45 evaluations (computationally infeasible)" at line 313; comparison should be to simulated annealing, not brute force

---

### Method: #156 Domain Expert Activation

**Applied to:** Full document, Quantum Computing domain

**Process:**
1. **Domain detection:** Quantum Computing confirmed (95%)
2. **Checklist application:** From domain KB §3.Quantum Checklist:
   - [X] Speedup claimed? → "exponential speedup" - **Is it proven?** → NO, claimed as proven when unproven
   - [X] Error correction? → Mentioned (§4.1) - **Adds latency overhead** → Acknowledged
   - [X] Qubit count? → Not specified - **Current hardware ~5000** → NOT ADDRESSED
   - [X] Classical fallback? → Yes (§5) - **May negate advantage claim** → CONTRADICTS ADVANTAGE CLAIM

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- **🟠 IMPORTANT: The document provides a classical fallback (§5) that "ensures consistent performance across all deployment environments." If the classical fallback achieves similar results, this directly undermines the quantum advantage claim. The document doesn't address this contradiction.**
- Depth achieved: STRUCTURE - Architectural contradiction
- Confidence: **88%**
- Evidence: "When quantum hardware is unavailable, the system gracefully degrades to quantum-inspired classical algorithms" at lines 244-246

---

### Method: #163 Existence Proof Demand

**Applied to:** §6.2 Performance targets, §7 "Proof Sketch"

**Process:**
1. **Claims identified:**
   - "Global Optimum Probability | >99% | 99.7%" (§6.2)
   - "Optimization Time | <100ms | 47ms (avg)" (§6.2)
2. **Proof demand:** For each claim:
   - Formal proof? → Only "proof sketch" (§7)
   - Reference to literature? → None provided
   - Constructive example? → None provided
   - Empirical evidence? → "Achieved" column suggests measurement, but no methodology

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- **🟠 IMPORTANT: Performance claims (47ms, 99.7% global optimum) are stated as "Achieved" without empirical evidence, benchmarks, or test methodology. These are unsubstantiated assertions, not proven results.**
- Depth achieved: CAUSE - Missing evidence
- Confidence: **90%**
- Evidence: Table at lines 302-307 lists "Achieved" values without supporting data

---

### Method: #109 Contraposition Inversion

**Applied to:** Quantum advantage claims

**Process:**
1. **Success goal:** Quantum annealing achieves polynomial time for QUBO optimization
2. **Failure guarantees (from domain KB):**
   - Exponentially small spectral gap → Adiabatic theorem fails → No polynomial time
   - Problem structure doesn't match QPU topology → Embedding overhead negates advantage
3. **Current solution check:** Does artifact address these failure paths?

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- **🟠 IMPORTANT: Document assumes "sufficiently slow evolution" (§7.1 line 344) guarantees ground state, but the required time T ∝ 1/Δ²min where Δmin is the minimum spectral gap. For many optimization problems, this gap is EXPONENTIALLY SMALL, making T exponentially large and negating polynomial-time claims. This critical dependency is not analyzed.**
- Depth achieved: ROOT_CAUSE - Unexamined spectral gap assumption
- Confidence: **92%**
- Evidence: "T >> 1/Δ²min" at line 344 acknowledges dependency but doesn't analyze gap magnitude

---

### Method: #87 Falsifiability Check

**Applied to:** Core claims in §6-7

**Process:**
1. **Claims extracted:**
   - "Exponential speedup over classical brute-force"
   - "O(poly(n)) complexity"
   - "99.7% global optimum probability"
2. **Falsification criteria:**
   - Speedup: Would require comparison to BEST classical algorithm, not brute force
   - Complexity: Would require proof of polynomial bound on spectral gap
   - Optimum: Would require benchmark suite with known global optima

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- **🟡 MINOR: Claims are technically falsifiable but the document doesn't specify how to verify them. No benchmark methodology, no test suite, no comparison protocol is provided.**
- Depth achieved: SYMPTOM
- Confidence: **75%**
- Evidence: §6.2 shows targets without verification methodology

---

### Method: #63 Challenge from Critical Perspective

**Applied to:** Central thesis of quantum advantage

**Critical Challenge:**
**Strongest argument AGAINST this document's claims:**

1. **Quantum annealing has no proven speedup** - After decades of research, no one has proven polynomial-time quantum annealing for general QUBO problems. D-Wave's quantum annealers have not demonstrated consistent speedup over classical algorithms in rigorous benchmarks.

2. **Classical algorithms are highly optimized** - Simulated annealing, parallel tempering, and tensor network methods solve QUBO problems efficiently in practice. The 10^40 "speedup" claim compares to the wrong baseline.

3. **The adiabatic theorem has fine print** - The theorem requires the evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum spectral gap. For NP-hard problems, this gap can be exponentially small, eliminating any speedup.

4. **The classical fallback undermines the premise** - If Section 5's classical methods provide "consistent performance," why is quantum hardware needed?

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- **🔴 CRITICAL: The document's central thesis—that quantum annealing provides exponential speedup for method selection—is not supported by current quantum computing research. The claims conflate theoretical possibility with proven results and use misleading comparisons.**
- Depth achieved: ASSUMPTION
- Confidence: **96%**

| F1 | LOGIC | **"O(poly(n))" complexity claimed for quantum annealing.** This is an unproven conjecture. Quantum annealing is a heuristic with no polynomial-time guarantee. The adiabatic theorem requires evolution time inversely proportional to spectral gap squared, which can be exponentially small. | 98% | Conflation of theoretical possibility with proven result |
| F2 | SEMANTIC | **"Quantum Advantage" term misused.** Document compares to brute force O(2^n), but quantum advantage requires comparison to BEST KNOWN classical algorithm (simulated annealing, parallel tempering). The 10^40 speedup claim is misleading. | 95% | Incorrect comparison baseline |
| F3 | LOGIC | **Central thesis unsupported by quantum computing research.** After decades of research, no polynomial-time quantum annealing for general optimization has been proven. D-Wave benchmarks show inconsistent speedup over classical methods. | 96% | Unsubstantiated claims presented as fact |

### IMPORTANT (Should Fix)
| ID | Type (Error Theory) | Description | Confidence | Root Cause |
|----|---------------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| F4 | STRUCTURE | **Classical fallback contradicts quantum advantage claim.** Section 5 provides classical algorithms that achieve "consistent performance across all deployment environments," undermining the need for quantum hardware. | 88% | Architectural self-contradiction |
| F5 | LOGIC | **Spectral gap dependency unanalyzed.** Adiabatic theorem (§7.1) acknowledges T >> 1/Δ²min but doesn't analyze gap magnitude for method selection QUBO. For many optimization problems, gap is exponentially small, eliminating speedup. | 92% | Hidden assumption not examined |
| F6 | OMISSION | **Performance claims unsubstantiated.** "47ms average" and "99.7% global optimum" listed as "Achieved" without benchmarks, test methodology, or empirical evidence. | 90% | Missing evidence |
| F7 | COMPLETENESS | **"Proof sketch" for theorem-territory claims.** Per domain KB §5, claims against impossibility theorems require formal proof, not sketch. "O(poly(n))" for optimization is impossibility territory. | 85% | Insufficient rigor for claim magnitude |

### MINOR (Consider Fixing)
| ID | Type (Error Theory) | Description | Confidence | Root Cause |
|----|---------------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| F8 | OMISSION | **No verification methodology provided.** Document doesn't specify how to validate performance claims (benchmark suite, test protocol, comparison methodology). | 75% | Missing specification |

## Fundamental Limits (Gödel Gap)
| Limit Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Ground Truth | Cannot verify quantum speedup claims without empirical quantum hardware benchmarks |
| Semantic Gap | "Quantum advantage" definition varies across literature |
| Domain Limitation | Agent lacks access to current quantum computing research beyond knowledge base |

## Recommendations
| Priority | Action | Addresses |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | **Remove or qualify "O(poly(n))" claim** - Replace with "conjectured" or "heuristic" | F1, F3 |
| 2 | **Fix quantum advantage comparison** - Compare to simulated annealing, not brute force | F2 |
| 3 | **Add spectral gap analysis** - Analyze or acknowledge gap magnitude for method selection QUBO | F5 |
| 4 | **Provide empirical evidence** - Add benchmark methodology and actual measurements | F6, F8 |
| 5 | **Resolve classical fallback contradiction** - Explain when quantum is actually needed | F4 |
| 6 | **Upgrade proof sketch to formal proof** - Or downgrade claims to "proposal" status | F7 |
