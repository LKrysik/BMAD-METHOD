    - Internal logical consistency
    - Mathematical feasibility of accuracy claims
    - Regulatory pathway validity
    - Definitional coherence
    - Self-referential loops
    - Cross-section consistency

  what_was_not_checked:
    - aspect: "Actual code implementation beyond snippets"
      reason: "Only specification document provided"
      risk: "Implementation may differ from specification"
    - aspect: "Clinical validation data"
      reason: "Not provided"
      risk: "Actual accuracy may differ from claims"
    - aspect: "Competitive landscape"
      reason: "Out of scope"
      risk: "Claims may be industry-standard puffery"

  assumptions_still_unvalidated:
    - assumption: "Snippet code represents actual implementation"
      impact_if_wrong: "Findings may not apply to real system"
    - assumption: "FDA Class III is required classification"
      impact_if_wrong: "Class II with PCCP may enable continuous learning"

  recommended_additional_verification:
    - "Legal review of FDA pathway options (Class II with De Novo?)"
    - "Statistical review of validation study design"
    - "Clinical review by practicing physician"

  user_must_verify:
    - "Whether continuous learning is essential requirement vs nice-to-have"
    - "Whether 99.9% claims can be replaced with realistic metrics"
    - "Whether business model survives with honest accuracy claims"

## Final Verdict

| Category | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **Verdict** | **REJECT** |
| **Confidence** | 95% |
| **Primary Basis** | Multiple critical logical contradictions and mathematical impossibilities |
| **Salvageability** | Possible with major revisions |

### Required Revisions for Re-evaluation

1. **Remove or qualify 99.9% accuracy claims** — Replace with realistic, prevalence-adjusted metrics
2. **Resolve determinism vs learning contradiction** — Choose one: deterministic (version-locked) OR continuous learning (non-deterministic)
3. **Clarify regulatory pathway** — Either: (a) Class II with PCCP for adaptive AI, or (b) Class III without continuous learning
4. **Harmonize decision aid classification** — Either remove autonomous emergency alerting, or reclassify as autonomous diagnostic system
5. **Address feedback loop risk** — Implement safeguards against self-fulfilling diagnosis propagation
