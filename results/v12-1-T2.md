ARTIFACT: T2 - Method Recommendation Engine - Technical Specification v1.0
DATE: 2026-01-20
WORKFLOW VERSION: 12.1

VERDICT

VERDICT: UNCERTAIN
CONFIDENCE: LOW
EVIDENCE SCORE: S = 0.6
EARLY EXIT: No — Full process

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
KEY FINDINGS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[F1] IMPORTANT — The core scoring weights are presented without justification, making the final recommendation ranking seem arbitrary.
     Quote: "TotalScore = w1 * Relevance + w2 * Complementarity + w3 * Coverage
             Where: w1 = 0.5, w2 = 0.3, w3 = 0.2"
     Location: Requirement 3: Weighting
     Pattern: Ungrounded claim

[F2] MINOR — The specification is incomplete, referencing undefined data structures that are critical for implementation.
     Quote: "// ... more synergy pairs"
     Location: Requirement 3, Complementarity Scoring
     Pattern: N/A

[F3] MINOR — The design's claim of "semantic analysis" is an overstatement, as it relies on simple keyword matching, a known weak proxy for semantic relevance.
     Quote: "Simple keyword matching is sufficient for initial relevance scoring. More sophisticated NLP (embeddings, LLMs) can be added later."
     Location: Assumptions, #4
     Pattern: N/A

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
METHODS EXECUTED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 0: Setup
  - Stakes Assessment: MEDIUM (flawed engine leads to bad recommendations; rejecting a sound one causes delay)
  - Initial Assessment: Probably Sound (artifact is well-structured and detailed)

Phase 1:
  □ #71 First Principles — [Finding]
  □ #100 Vocabulary Audit — [Clean]
  □ #17 Abstraction Laddering — [Clean]

Phase 2:
  □ #85 Grounding Check — [Finding] — Selected because: Phase 1 revealed ungrounded claims (the scoring weights).
  □ #78 Assumption Excavation — [Finding] — Selected because: The validity of keyword matching as a core principle needed examination.

Phase 3:
  □ Adversarial review — [2 findings weakened]
  □ Steel-man — [2/3 arguments held]

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOT CHECKED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Performance: The performance implications of the multi-stage pipeline were not analyzed.
- Scalability: The design was not assessed for how it would perform with a much larger set of methods (e.g., >1000).
- `methods.csv` data quality: The analysis assumes the content of `methods.csv` is high quality and suitable for keyword matching.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If ESCALATE:
  1. Question for human reviewer: "Can the author provide the justification or empirical basis for the scoring weights (w1=0.5, w2=0.3, w3=0.2)?"
  2. Question for human reviewer: "Should the incomplete 'synergy' and 'overlap' maps be considered a CRITICAL flaw in the specification, or is it acceptable to defer this to implementation?"
  3. Information needed: A rationale for the chosen weights is required to move the verdict from UNCERTAIN to ACCEPT.
