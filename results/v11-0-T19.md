## Evidence Trail

**[F1] Method #100 | Vocabulary Audit | Belief shift: P(H_LOGICAL) 0.18 → 0.37**
- **Observation:** The document claims properties that are difficult to reconcile: VCG-style strategyproofness and exact budget balance.
- **Evidence:** Section 4.2 proposes a "Redistribution Mechanism" to enforce budget balance but critically fails to define how an agent's `contribution_i` is calculated. If it depends on the agent's bid, strategyproofness is violated.
- **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Increased belief in logical/structural flaws.

**[F2] Method #17 | Abstraction Laddering | Belief shift: P(H_LOGICAL) 0.37 → 0.40, P(H_MINOR) 0.49 → 0.53**
- **Observation:** The Fairness Controller (Sec 6.2), the Budget Balancer (Sec 4.2), and the core VCG auction (Sec 4.1) are presented as separate components without analysis of their negative interactions.
- **Evidence:** The Fairness Controller provides a "tie_breaker_preference" which can be gamed, and the Budget Balancer interferes with VCG's incentive properties. The system is structurally unsound due to these conflicts.
- **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Increased belief in structural and logical flaws.

**[F3] Method #154 & #153 | Definitional Contradiction & Theoretical Impossibility | Belief shift: P(H_FATAL) 0.01 → 0.40, P(H_LOGICAL) 0.40 → 0.48**
- **Observation:** The artifact's core claims are a direct contradiction of a known impossibility theorem in mechanism design.
- **Evidence:** The design claims to simultaneously achieve (1) Strategyproofness (via VCG), (2) Allocative Efficiency, and (3) Exact Budget Balance. The Green-Laffont impossibility theorem proves that no mechanism can satisfy these three properties on an unrestricted domain of preferences. The document presents no novel mathematics to justify how it overcomes this impossibility.
- **Likelihood ratio contribution:** Strong evidence for a fatal flaw. This finding triggered the SPRT early exit.

## Verdict Logic

| SPRT Result | max P(H) | Verdict |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| REJECT (S ≥ 6) | H_FATAL or H_LOGICAL > 0.5 (combined P > 0.8) | **REJECT** |

## Action Items

```
VERDICT: REJECT

CONFIDENCE: high (SPRT termination with S=7.8)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. **Theoretical Impossibility Violation:** The core claims of the artifact violate the Green-Laffont impossibility theorem by promising strategyproofness, efficiency, and exact budget balance simultaneously without providing a novel proof that would make this possible. — evidence strength: strong
2. **Critically Underspecified Mechanism:** The budget redistribution mechanism (Sec 4.2) and the fairness controller (Sec 6.2) are underspecified and their interaction with the core VCG auction is not analyzed. This unresolved complexity likely breaks the primary game-theoretic properties of the system. — evidence strength: strong

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. **Acknowledge Impossibility:** The authors must fundamentally revise the design to acknowledge the trade-off between strategyproofness and budget balance. They must choose which property to relax (e.g., use standard VCG and accept a deficit, or use a mechanism that is not fully strategyproof).
2. **Remove Contradictory Claims:** All claims of achieving the three conflicting properties simultaneously must be removed.
3. **Fully Specify Mechanisms:** The `contribution_i` metric for redistribution and the mechanics of the "Fairness Controller" must be fully specified and analyzed for their impact on agent incentives.

REMAINING UNCERTAINTY:
- The analysis of the Combinatorial Clock Auction's real-time performance (Sec 3.3) was skipped because the theoretical flaws were terminal. The performance claims are highly optimistic and would have been the next target for verification.
