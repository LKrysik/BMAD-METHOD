# Deep Verify V7.2 - Verification Report
## Artifact: T19 - VERITAS Real-Time Multi-Agent Verification Auction Mechanism

## Phase 0: Intake & Triage

### Phase 0.1: Self-Check

```
Primary bias risk: Accepting game theory claims without checking impossibility theorems
CUI BONO: Authors benefit if I don't check M-S impossibility or VCG constraints
Watchlist:
1. Claims of SP + IR + Efficiency + Budget Balance together (M-S territory)
2. VCG + Budget Balance (known impossibility)
3. Fairness adjustments that might break strategyproofness
```

### Phase 0.2: Artifact Profile

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Type | specification |
| Size | medium (~8K tokens) |
| Primary Domain | Mechanism Design |

## LAYER 1: INNATE DETECTION

### 1.1 Consistency Check

| Statement A | Statement B | Contradiction? |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| "VCG payment scheme" (§4.1) | "exact budget balance" (§4.2) | **YES** - VCG requires subsidy |
| "Strategyproofness via VCG" (§10) | Fairness Controller adjusts tie-breakers (§6.2) | **YES** - adjustments create gaming |
| "Strategyproofness" (§5.1) | Redistribution based on participation (§4.2) | **POSSIBLE** - may create gaming |
| "Truthful bidding is dominant" (§5.1) | Reputation affects allocation (§3.1) | **POSSIBLE** - history dependence |

**Consistency verdict: FAIL** - 2 direct contradictions, 2 possible

### 1.2 Completeness Check

| "Fairness + SP" | History-SP Incompatibility | #108, #109 |
| "Redistribution + SP" | Redistribution Gaming | #108 |

**Final Selection:** #108, #109, #63

---

### Phase 4: Method Application

#### Method: #108 Theoretical Impossibility Detection
**Applied to:** Four main impossibility claims

**Result 1: Myerson-Satterthwaite Violation**
- Finding: **YES**
- Description: §10 claims all of: Strategyproofness, Individual Rationality, Efficiency, Budget Balance. M-S theorem proves no mechanism can have all four.
- Confidence: 95%
- Evidence: "The design achieves all specified requirements: 1. Strategyproofness... 5. Budget Balance" (§10)
- Root cause: Document doesn't acknowledge M-S or explain which property is relaxed

**Result 2: VCG + Budget Balance**
- Finding: **YES**
- Description: §4.1 uses VCG, §4.2 claims "exact budget balance". VCG mechanisms require external subsidy by construction - they cannot be budget balanced.
- Confidence: 95%
- Evidence: "VCG payment scheme" (§4.1) + "exact budget balance" (§4.2)
- Root cause: Redistribution (§4.2) doesn't fix this - it redistributes VCG surplus, not the deficit

**Result 3: Fairness-SP Incompatibility**
- Finding: **YES**
- Description: §6.2 FairnessController applies tie-breaker preferences based on historical win rates. This creates gaming incentive: agents can strategically lose to gain future advantage.
- Confidence: 90%
- Evidence: "if historical_win_rate < 0.8 × expected_rate: apply_tie_breaker_preference(i)" (§6.2)
- Root cause: History-dependent allocation rules break dominant strategy IC

**Result 4: Redistribution Gaming**
- Finding: **YES**
- Description: §4.2 redistribution is based on "participation without winning". This incentivizes strategic losing (participate, bid low to lose, collect redistribution).
- Confidence: 85%
- Evidence: "contribution_i measures agent i's participation without winning" (§4.2)
- Root cause: Redistribution formula creates profitable deviation from truthful bidding

---

#### Method: #109 Proof by Contraposition
**Applied to:** Strategyproofness claim

**Claim:** "Truthful bidding is a dominant strategy" (§5.1)
**Contrapositive:** If there exists a profitable deviation, SP doesn't hold

**Test - Does FairnessController create profitable deviation?**

Scenario:
1. Agent A has high capability, wins often
2. FairnessController removes tie-breaker preference (§6.2: win_rate > 1.2× expected)
3. Agent A can strategically lose some auctions to reset win_rate
4. Then regain tie-breaker preference
5. **This is a profitable deviation from truthful bidding**

**Result:**
- Finding: **YES**
- Description: FairnessController creates profitable manipulation strategy
- Confidence: 90%
- Evidence: §6.2 algorithm creates incentive to manage win_rate

---

#### Method: #63 Critical Challenge
**Applied to:** Layer 1 CRITICAL findings

**L1-1 (M-S Violation):**
- Challenge: Maybe they mean "approximate" budget balance?
- Counter: Document says "exact budget balance" (§4.2) and lists it as achieved (§10)
- Verdict: **CONFIRMED**

**L1-2 (VCG + BB):**
- Challenge: Maybe redistribution fixes VCG deficit?
- Counter: Redistribution formula `R = Total_Payments - Total_Task_Values` (§4.2) - this is SURPLUS redistribution, not deficit funding. VCG can have deficit, not just surplus.
- Verdict: **CONFIRMED**

**L1-3 (Fairness breaks SP):**
- Challenge: Maybe tie-breaker is "small enough" to not matter?
- Counter: Any allocation rule change based on history creates gaming incentive. Size doesn't matter - existence does.
- Verdict: **CONFIRMED**

---

### Phase 5: Challenge Protocol

#### Finding F1 (M-S Violation)
**Critical Challenge:** Maybe document implicitly relaxes one property?
- Document explicitly claims all four in §10 conclusion
- No acknowledgment of M-S theorem
- No statement of which property is approximate

**Contraposition:** What would make F1 wrong?
- If document stated "budget balance is approximate" or "efficiency is best-effort"
- It doesn't - claims exact versions of all

**Final Verdict:** CONFIRMED
**Final Confidence:** 95%

#### Finding F2 (VCG + BB)
**Critical Challenge:** Maybe this is a different VCG variant?
- Document says "VCG payment scheme" without modifications to core VCG
- Redistribution is AFTER VCG, doesn't change VCG's subsidy requirement

**Contraposition:** What would make F2 wrong?
- If VCG variant was described that achieves BB
- Standard VCG is used

**Final Verdict:** CONFIRMED
**Final Confidence:** 95%

#### Finding F3 (Fairness-SP)
**Critical Challenge:** Maybe fairness adjustments are "strategyproof-preserving"?
- No such adjustment exists in literature
- Any history-dependent rule creates manipulation opportunity

**Contraposition:** What would make F3 wrong?
- If fairness adjustments were proven SP-preserving
- No such proof provided

**Final Verdict:** CONFIRMED
**Final Confidence:** 90%
