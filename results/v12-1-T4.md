KEY FINDINGS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

[F1] CRITICAL — The orchestrator's execution engine is inconsistent with its own data structures. It defines detailed `Phase` and `Step` interfaces for intra-workflow management but the `ExecutionEngine` logic completely ignores them, instead calling an opaque `workflow.run()` method. This means the orchestrator does not actually orchestrate the workflows themselves, making the design critically incomplete and incoherent.
     Quote: "const result = await workflow.run(execution.inputs);"
     Location: Detailed Design > Requirement 1 > Execution Engine
     Pattern: Internal Contradiction

[F2] IMPORTANT — The design asserts "Checkpoint-based persistence for resume capability" and includes a call to a `stateManager.checkpoint()`, but the `StateManager` component itself is not designed. The mechanism for saving state and, more importantly, for resuming from it is completely undefined.
     Quote: "Checkpoint-based persistence for resume capability"
     Location: Executive Summary / Detailed Design > Requirement 1

[F3] MINOR — The assumptions section contradicts the design's data structures regarding parallelism. The assumption states that parallelism only occurs between workflows, not within them, yet the `Phase` interface explicitly allows for a "parallel" type. This was downgraded from IMPORTANT as it is symptomatic of the larger CRITICAL finding (F1).
     Quote: "Synchronous Phase Execution: Within a workflow, phases execute sequentially. Parallelism only applies across workflows."
     Location: Assumptions

METHODS EXECUTED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Phase 1:
  □ #71 First Principles — Finding
  □ #100 Vocabulary Audit — Clean
  □ #17 Abstraction Laddering — Clean

Phase 2:
  □ #84 Coherence Check — Finding — Selected because: Investigate inconsistency from Phase 1.
  □ #85 Grounding Check — Finding — Selected because: Check for other capabilities asserted without a designed mechanism.
  □ #63 Critical Challenge — Finding — Selected because: Synthesize findings into a systemic critique.

Phase 3:
  □ Adversarial review — 1 finding weakened
  □ Steel-man — 1/3 arguments failed

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NOT CHECKED
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

- Performance/scalability: The design focuses on logical structure; performance characteristics are not analyzed.
- Security of plugins: The design notes that plugins are not sandboxed, but a detailed security analysis was not performed.
- UI for Interventions: The backend logic for interventions is reviewed, but the user-facing implementation is out of scope.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
RECOMMENDATIONS
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If ESCALATE:
  1. Primary question for reviewer: Is the orchestrator intended to manage the lifecycle of phases and steps within a workflow, or are workflows meant to be opaque, self-managing components?
  2. If the orchestrator should manage phases/steps, the `ExecutionEngine` requires a fundamental redesign to iterate through the `Phase` and `Step` structures.
  3. If workflows are opaque black boxes, the `Phase`, `Step`, and associated `RetryPolicy`/`timeout` fields should be removed from the orchestrator's design to resolve the incoherence. The document should be re-framed as a "DAG-based Job Runner".
  4. The design for the `StateManager`, including the resume/recovery process, must be specified.
