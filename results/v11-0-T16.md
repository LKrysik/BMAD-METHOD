# Deep Verify V11.0 Report: artifact-t16.md

## Phase 0: Prior Construction

### Self-Calibration
- **Expected Outcome:** The artifact was expected to be complex and likely contain minor flaws or ungrounded claims due to the strong security assertions made.
- **Stance:** Verification, not confirmation.
- **Mind-Changer:** A direct contradiction in security claims or protocols.

### Evidence Trail

**[F1] Method #71 First Principles & #105 Epoché | Belief shift: P(H_FATAL) 0.15 → 0.35, P(H_LOGICAL) 0.15 -> 0.31**

*   **Observation:** The artifact claims to provide "perfect forward secrecy" (PFS) while simultaneously describing a "Compliance Recovery Protocol" that escrows the `session_key` for future recovery. These two features are fundamentally contradictory. PFS requires that session key material is permanently destroyed and unrecoverable after a session concludes, even by the system's operators. The described escrow mechanism creates a means to recover past session keys, thereby violating the core principle of PFS.

*   **Evidence:**
    *   **Claim of PFS (Section 5.1):** "The system achieves perfect forward secrecy through ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange for each session. Compromise of long-term agent identity keys does not enable decryption of past session data..."
    *   **Contradictory Mechanism (Section 4.2):** The `Recovery_Record` is defined to contain the session key, encrypted with a long-term Recovery Authority key:
        ```
        Recovery_Record = {
            ...
            encrypted_session_key: RSA-OAEP(RA_PubKey, session_key),
            ...
        }
        ```
    *   **Analysis:** Compromise of the `RA_PubKey`'s private key would allow decryption of all past `session_key`s stored in `Recovery_Record`s. This is a single point of failure that breaks the PFS guarantee for all historical communication. The security of past sessions does not depend on ephemeral keys (which are deleted) but on the long-term security of the Recovery Authority's key.

*   **Likelihood ratio contribution:** This finding provides strong evidence for H_LOGICAL (internal contradiction) and H_FATAL (violation of a core security theorem claimed by the design). The evidence score contribution is `+6` (2x CRITICAL findings), triggering an immediate stop.

### Verdict Logic

| SPRT Result | max P(H) | Verdict |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| REJECT (S ≥ 6) | H_FATAL or H_LOGICAL > 0.5 (0.35+0.31=0.66) | **REJECT** |

### Action Items

```
VERDICT: REJECT

CONFIDENCE: High (based on SPRT margin and direct contradiction)

KEY FINDINGS:
1. The system's claim of "perfect forward secrecy" is invalidated by the "Compliance Recovery Protocol." The design escrows session keys, creating a single point of failure for the security of all past sessions. This is a fatal logical contradiction. — evidence strength: strong

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. **Re-classify the system:** Remove all claims of "perfect forward secrecy." The system provides "escrowed security" or "recoverable security," not PFS. The term PFS is misleading and factually incorrect given the architecture.
2. **Fundamental Redesign (if PFS is a hard requirement):** To achieve true PFS, the compliance mechanism cannot escrow the session key itself. Alternative (and complex) designs would need to be explored, such as methods that require multiple independent parties to reconstruct any information, without a single master recovery key existing.

REMAINING UNCERTAINTY:
- Due to the early exit triggered by the fatal flaw, other potential issues in the areas of post-quantum implementation, zero-knowledge proof soundness, or key rotation logic were not investigated.
- The analysis of `Homomorphic Key Aggregation` (Section 5.4) was skipped, as its security is moot if the underlying session keys are not secure as claimed.
